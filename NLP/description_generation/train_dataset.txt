"Dwarf likes reading history, especially about heroes and battles that are often overlooked in traditional history books."
"Elves are tall, agile, graceful, wise, fair."
Faeries are quick to do you a favor and even quicker to demand payment for it.
Honors their deep dwarf roots by lighting the end of their braids or moustache on fire before battle to intimidate enemies.

"A brutal, physical warrior, the Barbarian roams around the battlefield constantly, dishing heavy damage and wielding an array of powerful weapons with ease."
"Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully."
"Elves are generally considered one of the most beautiful races. They are slightly shorter and more delicate than humans and are not as hardy. Elves are a rare sight on the sword coast perhaps because they prefer the wild to human cities. While they are well known as a cheerful and frolicsome race, many elves, especially drow, are as surly as dwarves or as prideful as humans."
"Elves love nature, plants, animals, musical instruments, seeds, bags, tools."
"The Barbarian is a champion, swordsman, swordswoman, soldier, and brawler who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics. Barbarians can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good Barbarian needs to be strong and healthy if they hope to survive."
"Favorite things: Adventures, maps, friendship, animals and board games, sailing and spending time in the spa."
"Most dwarven clans focused on one or two kinds of crafting, such as blacksmithing, jewelry, engineering, or masonry. Dwarves strove to avoid overspecialization by sending some of their youths to other clans to serve as apprentices, which also helped to foster racial unity. Because of their longevity, these apprenticeships might last decades."
"Dwarf is scared of orcs, but does everything humanly possibly to deny this."
"For some Barbarians, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength."
"Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder. Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies. Elves are glamorous. They project glamour. Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment. Elves are terrific. They beget terror. The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. No one ever said elves are nice. Elves are bad."
Dwarf is petrified of open water. Dwarf can't swim.
"Faerie is creature type used for cards that depict creatures with human appearance, often small stature, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery."
"There is no cultural norm for hair color, but most barbarians have dark hair or hair that is dark at the roots and light at the ends."
Dwarf can't let a dare or slight against his courage slip by him. Always bites when someone calls him a chicken.
"Wizards were a form of a spellcaster who learned the art of arcane magic through research and learning.  What wizards lacked in combat prowess and armor they made up with a broad range of magical spells and abilities learned through years of practice and training. Through their spellcasting ability, powerful wizards could control the battlefield, using spells that affected wide areas, often hindering enemies, while also learning to use powerful rituals of arcane power."
"Specialist wizards are treated and regarded as wizards by the world at large in spite of this specialization and many regarded themselves as such, though sometimes distinctions are made for diviners, illusionists, and necromancers. "
Barbarian is a crude uncouth ill-bred person lacking culture or refinement.
"Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface in the mountains, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did."
"Faeries are magical by nature and live in magical, pink biom."
"Barbarians are mighty warriors who relied on their strength and incredible toughness, characterized by a bestial rage empowered either by ancestral totems and nature spirits or an inner passion for violence. Barbarians were less versatile than fighters but were tougher and capable of dealing heavy damage to their foes much more quickly."
"Wizards wear only cloth armor, but compensate for this with a range of armor spells, wreathing themselves in flame, frost or even arcane energies. Nonetheless, when fighting melee opponents, wizards stay alive by incapacitating attackers and always keeping one step ahead - and well out of reach. Wizards are quick and can blink away from attackers, use invisibility to slip into the shadows. Wizards are masters of kiting, and can use their enviable range of snares and crowd control abilities to defeat whole groups of opponents without putting a hair out of place."
A Wizard gains their spellcasting power by making a deal with a demon or another dark being.
"Some faeries are helpful. They guide travelers who are lost in the forest back towards home. They help with household chores, often going to work overnight, so that their hosts wake up to a happy surprise. If they are particularly fond of you, they might even lead you to treasure, give you magical gifts, help you win your true love hand in marriage, or cast a lucky charm over your life."
"Elf has purple hair that is kept neatly combed. He also has turquoise eyes, a dark complexion, and two Elf Tattoos - one, a geometric design on his cheek, and the other, a pattern of swirls on his shoulder."
"Barbarian character has a sense of community and responsibility. Barbarians are loyal to their friends and family, and they have an obligation to protect the weak and innocent. Barbarians are used to adapting to dangerous situations and taking care of themselves. Barbarians have seen terrible things, but they choose to keep fighting so that they can protect others."
"Faeries come in many forms, and have been described as magical and mischievous beings from the realm next door. This realm is considered another dimension or reality. Faeries have been classified into two groups - one consisting of light faeries and the other dark ones. However, there have not been many details about identifying faerie classes."
Regrets serving their old god and is looking for a new one.
Some elves tend to have a more powerful and muscular build than other elves.
"Elves tend to be taller and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing, frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. "
"Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise."
"Most of wizards like isolation, as it means they can carry out their dangerous experiments undisturbed by others and only leave their enclaves either to accumulate more power or the necessary wealth to continue their research."
"Wizards are bastions of divine light, meting out justice with magic and might."
"Barbarian is a creature class. Barbarians, are warriors who have sworn their service and their lives to a single authority figure, usually a feudal lord."
"Dwarves could see in the dark, out to about 60 feet (18 meters). Many dwarves had an affinity for the caverns in which they lived, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could seem almost supernatural at times."
"Wizards can utilize their skill to ensure that enemies focus on them, defending weaker members of their group. Their potent healing abilities ensure that their allies remain in fighting shape and can be resurrect, while they charge their weapons with holy might, allowing them to deal additional damage with their strikes. As champions of order, wizards are extremely potent in a group - their blessings and auras can improve damage and survivability for both themselves and their party, while withstanding heavy physical damage with plate armor and strong defensive abilities."
"Elves are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. "

Elves occasionally also were benevolent and helpful.
"Elves do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire."
"Dwarves were a long-lived race, though not so much as elves, and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she reached age fifty. Dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer period of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 years. Most dwarves lived to see their bicentennial and a few lived to be over 400. A dwarf was considered to be young until they reached the age of 50."
"Some fairies, even some of the most ugly and horrifying, can be benevolent and helpful. Other fairies can be evil and malicious, even some of the most beautiful. What they have in common is that all fairies are considered to be both mischievous and capricious. They love to play tricks and their attitude can change from happy or friendly to ferocious without warning if they are somehow offended."
"Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud."
"Barbarians are all about getting angry and dealing damage. They have a ton of hit points, resistance to damage, and Rage gives a wonderful bonus to damage. Barbarians don't get much in the way of skills, so generally they're stuck as combat monsters, but they function equally well as a defender and a striker, and certain character options can even expand them into a limited support role."
"Faeries specialize in the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or a far away location. Faeries are notable for possessing an unusually high wisdom from wizards, with strong and cautious judgment, preferring to use violence only as a last resort. Many faeries are also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all matters."
"Faeries are not necessarily cowards but exhaust all other options before proceeding into combat. While faeries can be useful due to their anticipation of others' attacks some are irritatingly hesitant, making them nigh useless at times. When forced into battle, faeries are in natural opposition to illusionists, whose tricks they can unravel with their own spells."
Barbarian is an insulting word for a person from an uncivilized culture or a person with no manners. Barbarians aren't known for their etiquette.
"Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to."
"Wizards are hosts of dark forces, sowing pestilence and horror."
"The earliest, and most common, faerie in Lovey-dovey Land are winged humanoid creatures of diminutive size (sometimes a foot in height or smaller) that are renowned for being great lovers of mischief. These faeries exist through the multiverse. These are also sometimes known as fae, pixies or sprites."
"As for armor, Dwarves favored chain-mail and other metallic armor where the most expensive and precious of which was ring mail made of gold."
Dwarf attempts to wrestles beasts/animals before hitting them with a weapon.
"Wizards can be good or evil and have no overall strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters are chaotic over evil, though only by a slim margin. Good wizards are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another's being's free will, while evil enchanters show little such restraint."
"Faeries love honey cake, milk, nectar, and sweet butter."
"As time typically flows differently for them and in their realm, they are very long-lived and become only more artful and powerful as they age, though they are not immortal."
"Bad faeries are mischievous. They delight in misleading travelers or luring them into exhausting dances that go one for days. They also like to taunt domestic animals, pinching horses to make them gallop, stealing milk from cows, and playing cat-and-mouse with cats."
"Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge."
Wizards are dark avengers who call upon the darkness to spread evil and conquer the world.
"Elves are wise, honorable, honest, well known and liked, idealistic, tactful, polite, patient, good listener, and a bit mysterious."

"While there's no cultural norm for eye color, most barbarians have dark eyes."
"Barbarians train constantly and strive for perfection in armed combat. Though they come from all walks of life, they are united in their singular commitment to engage in glorious battle. Many warriors serve as mercenary soldiers, while others become adventurers and danger-seeking fortune hunters. A typical warrior is strong, tough, and exceptionally violent."
"He is logical, loyal, and down-to-earth. He will sometimes burst into long motivational speeches that the others tend to ignore. A stickler for safety, he will pay attention to rules and details that may escape his friends' notice. Even when he doesn't have all the answers, he will try to act like he knows what he's doing, so that the others will look up to him for leadership. He especially likes to eat delicious pastry foods made by the local elf."
The oldest and strongest faeries are fallen angels.
Elves have keener senses than Men.
"Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance."
"Dwarven soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because it can be used as a tool or a weapon, but in addition to axes they used hatchets, mattocks, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionally there is mention of dwarven archers."
"Elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, though they were not usually considered past adolescence until they reached 110 years of age. Unlike humans, elves did not age dramatically as their lifespan came to a close, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening. Most elves remained healthy and full of life up until their death, which, if age-related, was usually between two and nine centuries."
Elves are immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime.

"Barbarian likes his life of adventure, traveling the countryside, earning gold, and drinking. "
"Barbarians have tough, thick skin and are sometimes covered in scars. They often have a healthy tan."
"Dwarves are a short but stocky race that inhabits Frozen Empire. What a regular dwarf lacks in in height (measuring between 4 and 5 feet), he makes up for in bulk, weighing as much as a mature human. Dwarven males are a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts."
"It is unusual for a barbarian to worship a god. Barbarians generally find it more natural to worship a pantheon of gods or nature. Many barbarians believe that they are a living incarnation of a god. Although barbarians have no formal religion, they have a strong sense of honor and loyalty. They try to emulate their gods by living in harmony with nature and fulfilling their duties."
"Faeries can be carelessly cruel, capricious, and vindictive. It is thought that faeries do not dream, which would explain why they spend so much time harvesting the dreams of others. Faeries can distill these stolen dreams into sparkling energy that they carry around with them."
"Elf has a special bond with nature (on land), can make anything grow and thrive, can magically talk to plants and animals, is physically strong."
"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk."
"Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races. Elves were agile, dexterous creatures. However, elves could move slightly faster than their eladrin kin and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Elves were also more preternaturally aware of their surroundings than eladrin, as well as possessing better common sense. This aided elves in many ways, allowing elves a high degree of perceptiveness that they could lend partially to allies. Additionally, elves were extremely accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids."
Dwarf secretly appreciates elven made weaponry and dreams of learning from a master elven smith.
"Wizards do battle to spread the shadows into the world. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the evil creatures and shadows which would serve them in the battle."
"Wizards are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the light would shine upon. The light radiates from wizards, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power."
Faeries are magical beings.
"Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality they are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal."
"Barbarian is a very friendly, outgoing person who just loves to share a good drink with anyone willing to listen. Barbarian is never afraid to speak his mind, even if it gets him in trouble. Barbarian is happy with his life as an adventurer and looks forward to seeing the world. Barbarian loves a good fight as much as the next barbarian, but he doesn't like to kill. Well, not all the time. If his life or a friend's life is in danger, he will totally destroy his enemies. He has a soft spot for other barbarians, however, even if they are from a different tribe."
"Long time ago, the dwarves made alliances with the elves, and both prospered from trade."
"Faeries collect unusually valuable things: coins of fallen empires, baby teeth, and memories of treasured name."
"They were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithying skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the Elves, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The skill of the Dwarves was unmatched they crafted objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Everything Dwarven was beautifully crafted and intricate. They crafted many famed weapons, armors, and items of art and beauty."
"As a weapon they very often use axes, swords, hammers, mattocks."
"Barbarians primary ability is strength, their saving throw proficiencies are strength and constitution."
"The Barbarian has unparalleled strength and expertly wields an entire arsenal in battle, with a weapon for every occasion. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shaking slams to send approaching hordes reeling."
All dwarfs have beards and wear up to twelve layers of clothing. Gender is more or less optional.

Elves are immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.
"Unlike other elves, Dark Elves are a brutal race of supremacists who hide their savagery behind a facade of beauty and sophistication. They are obsessed with physical attractiveness and believe that those who do not meet their standards of perfection (including all races other than themselves) deserve nothing but extermination. Dark Elves are tall and thin. "
Faeries are strongly magical and some of them are even immortal.
"Elf has dark-brown hair that is slightly tousled. He also has light-green eyes, a fair complexion, and two Elf Tattoos - one, a green zigzag on his cheek, and the other, the earth insignia (a leaf with three points) on his shoulder."
"Likes to hum 'Heigh Ho' to themselves. When asked why, they fervently deny it saying, 'I was not.'"
Dwarf is obsessed with finding rubies. He will take a hand full of rubies over a chest full of gold any day.
"The elves are deeply in tune with the flow of aether and the subtle ways it influences and shapes the natural world. Their inventions are inspired by nature and in turn they inspire others, offering a vision of progress that is elegant, efficient, and harmonious with the aether patterns. "
"Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world."
"Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 1.3 - 1.45 meters on average, with gold dwarves a bit shorter. What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk"
"Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes.  Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity."
"Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. "
Doesn't believe in orcs. He thinks those are just tall humans who work out.
"Wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. In particular, they learn most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their spellbooks, a method that allows them, unlike bards or sorcerers, to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards see themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, and scientists, studying a system of natural laws that are for the most part unknown and undiscovered."
"Elf is a lot stronger, both magically and personally than he thinks, responsible, kind, reliable, helpful, giving."
"Dwarf always carries around a small personal cask of ale for emergencies. Dwarf is concerned with filling it immediately after it empties, holds 4 servings of ale."
"Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes. Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity."
"Protects women with vastly more valor than men, even when he risks his own life."
"Barbarian is a creature class. They are tough and disciplined, adept at fighting in concert, and overwhelming the enemy."
"Winged elves have feathered wings and are capable of flight. They are more delicate than their earth-bound cousins, with hollow bones to aid their flight. They have pale skin and slightly larger than normal eyes."
Dark Elves have a pair of big horns growing from their foreheads.
"Most elves live far longer than humans, but it's unclear exactly how much. Elves not only live far longer than humans but also mature faster it is unknown if this is common to all elves or just those of the Enchated Forest."
"Elf has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead."


"Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes."
"Faeries can only be seen if they want to be. This ability continues to work, even after the fairy in question's death, meaning humans who haven't been to the fairy realm can't see their remains."

Some faeries have the ability to send someone pleasant dreams. It is considered a faerie gift.
"Rage is the Barbarian's defining class feature. The bonus damage isn't huge, but it's reliable and consistent. The resistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage multiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but your number of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid it."
"Barbarian has long dark hair and sharp yellow eyes. He has rough, black fur covering his body, and he has sharp fingernails and long, sharp teeth. He wears dark blue and black clothes, but he often carries around a black cloak and hood in case he needs to hide in the shadows."
This fearless warrior relies on his bulging muscles and striking mustache to wreak havoc in enemy villages. Release a horde of Barbarians and enjoy the mayhem!
"Dwarf has an intense fascination for plants. Likes flowers the most, with an especial interest for lilies."
"Combining a mastery of weapons and prowess in battle, Barbarians storm fearlessly into the front lines of any fight."
"Wizard is a battle-ready warrior for whom faith is a shield, and fights for what he believes to be right. His steadfastness gives him powers to bestow blessings to his friends and wreak cruel justice on foes. There are those who call the wizard an overwrought zealot, but others recognize in him the strength and goodness of the light."
"Elves typically live in forests, and are close to the land. In the game itself, many elves produce additional mana. Most elves look much like humans, only with pointed ears. Some types of elves have very distinctive physical features, however, such as blue or green skin or elongated limbs."
"Dwarf is very attracted to halflings, vastly more so then to other dwarves. But they'd never let their parents find out."
"As a Dark Elf, her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom."
"Barbarians are usually adventurers just because they don't really know what else to do. They have an inherent wanderlust and a desire to stand out. They have a strong sense of honor, so they often look for opportunities to prove themselves. They are natural leaders, so they often rise to leadership positions in groups."

"Wizard's magic is a unique blend of arcane magic with the elemental power of creation and those who specialize in it are known as evokers. Wizards are often stubbornly determined by nature and have little use for distractions of the real world, living in very often spartan conditions. Many wizards are decisive and forthright, who are sure of what they must do, be it good or evil, giving them many qualities of strong leadership."
"Stereotypes of faeries and wizards are often similar, they tend to see magic as a blunt instrument. In battle, they do tend to be unflinching in danger, confident in their summoned power to overcome any threat."
"Barbarian is a fighter, through and through. Barbarian is tough and headstrong, never giving up until his opponent is down. Barbarian is very loyal to his friends, and he uses his muscles and brawn to protect them."
Dwarf hates heights and actively avoids climbing unless they must.
"Elf is thoughtful, sensitive, and helpful. He has the patience and compassion needed to be a good dragon trainer. He is very knowledgeable about dragons, and his connection with them makes him a valuable elf to have around. His friends often come to him for treant-related advice, which he is always happy to give. He gives many compliments. Some might interpret this as flirting, but maybe he just sees the good in everyone around him."
Dwarf's skin is so rough that he can light a match on any part of his body.
"Barbarians have long, messy hair. They sometimes have beards. They are also some few characters who are allowed to wear their hair long."
"Faeries have long life spans, longer than other mortals and have the ability to choose when they die. They don't migrate to other lands."
"Dwarves were taught special skills and spent most of their time crafting, smithying and mining in their massive underground cities."

Elves can control water and have a special relationship with all animals.

"Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink."
Dwarf secretly hates beer as it's too bitter. Dwarf drinks rum instead.

"Their hair can be blond, brown, black, blue, red, and (when older) grey or white."


"Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease."
"Dwarf collects random animal parts, herbs, spices, and other unique ingredients in an attempt to craft the best ale in the world. Loves this hobby."
"Barbarian is tall and brawny. Barbarian has bright red hair, cropped short. His bright green eyes are constantly assessing his surroundings while he is out on the road. His vest is very practical, with a number of small pouches attached all around. Barbarian wears a small bag on his side, with a short sword strapped to his back."
Dwarf has an obsession with staking claims throughout the adventure in search of ore and gems. Has personalized metal spikes.
"Dwarf has ornate metal bands adorning their beard, of brass and bronze, decorated to pay homage to the adventures they have been on so far."
"Barbarians come in a lot of different shapes and sizes, but most tend to be taller and more muscular than other classes. They have faces that let them look intense and animalistic. They have powerful builds, so they're able to use heavy weapons and carry lots of equipment."
Elves are generally liked and even admired by humans and are easily accepted into their society. The same cannot be said for dwarves some of whom despise elves on principle.
"Barbarians have a strong sense of community and honor. They are proud and believe in living as close to nature as possible. Barbarians are also traditionalists. They respect the traditions of the past, especially those that are related to warfare and combat."
Keeps a record of the giants they've killed with notches in their axe or war hammer handle.
Dwarf constantly 'chalks up' their hands with dirt or dust from rocks to better their grip on their weapon.
"Most barbarians are noble and serve their duty unflinchingly. Barbarians are often equipped with a long sword and a short sword in many lands where barbarians are found, they are the only citizens allowed to carry more than one weapon. The ability, representing their power in combat, is exclusive to barbarians. Most barbarians are aligned with white."
"Dwarves are very similar to Humans but shorter. Many males wear long beards and live in mines, although some of them are known to live outside the mountains and even on islands."

"Dwarf is an avid wrestler, both the sport and the scripted spectacle. Knows all the underground wrestlers and where/when the biggest matches will be held. Goes every chance he gets."
"They seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle their soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and styles that were trademarks of Dwarven crafting styles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon."
"Glorified by many a song and fireside tale, the Barbarian is unrivaled in delivering unrelenting melee fury on anyone foolish enough to greet their axe-head."
"Wizard's soul is inundated with power.Wizards are a type of magic user. Athletic, affable, and self-assured, wizards hardly seem like scholarly bibliophiles hidden away from civilization. They possess many of the same skills as the male members of the magic clans, but excel at the use of elemental magic."
"Elf is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group."

"The most common faeries are associated with one of the six elements. The elemental faeries can control the forces of earth, air, water, light, fire and darkness."
"Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as halflings or gnomes, though this was not a trait common to all dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely unsocial and more than a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, something that sat well with their legendary crafting abilities."
Elves use typically swords and bows.
"Barbarians are usually leading the charge into battle, tearing across the battlefield and using furious shouts and terrifying banners to rally their allies and intimidate their enemies. Whether striking down opponents with mighty two-handed weapons, tearing into packs of enemies in a whirlwind of steel, or standing firm in the face of death itself, warriors excel at battle with a range of powerful attacks and battlefield maneuvers, as masters of both skillful strikes and devastating blows."
"Dwarves grimace and complain when they are outside for too long and have not been in a cave, mine, or other underground area for more than 8 days."
The Elves are a peaceful race that reside in their kingdom.
"Barbarians have a sense of duty and honor, and they follow a strict code. They consider their actions to be the result of the decisions that they make, and they would never seek to blame others for their decisions."
"Wizards often used arcane accessories, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands. These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically."
"As magical creatures, faeries have almost unlimited power. They can fly. They can make flowers bloom. They can conjure up gold. They can glow in the dark. They can create and cast new charms for any situation, and their curses can last for hundreds of years."
"Barbarian has a scar running along the left side of his face, from his forehead down to his chin. Barbarian got this from a duel with a baby dragon that got out of hand, as his previous battle scars testify. His left ear is also slightly deformed, but he wears an earring in it. Barbarian speaks with a thick accent and swears a lot. He's a loud, boisterous man who laughs and tells stories constantly. He acts like a berserker who fights for the fun of it. Overall, his appearance tends to scare people away, and he's fine with that."
"Dwarves were firm believers in the righteousness of their own ways, yet were surprisingly tolerant of the cultures of others, much of which was due to their natural introversion. Polite dwarves normally declined to speak their minds about others regardless of their true feelings"
"Barbarians equip themselves carefully for combat and engage their enemies head-on, letting attacks glance off their heavy armor. They use diverse combat tactics and a wide variety of weapon types to protect their more vulnerable allies. Barbarians must carefully master their rage - the power behind their strongest attacks - in order to maximize their effectiveness in combat."
Elves are said to have the most beautiful voices of all kinds. This makes them highly sought after by bards.
"Wizards do battle to protect the world from the forces of shadow. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the light to heal wounds, create shields of force, and incinerate evil creatures. "
"They had a knack for starting a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything. Although they knew how, Dwarves did not farm or herd often, as they preferred to spend their time underground mining and crafting. They rather traded crafted items with Men and Elves in exchange for food."
"Their arms tend to be long, and they have rough skin. Coming up with a good physical description for your barbarian character is important because it can help you to think about how your character's appearance will affect their behavior and outlook on life."
"Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to friends and family. They treat and care for each other, even strangers among their kind like family. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and gems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the elves. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often seen as greedy, but their nature gave them resistance to many external influences. "
"Barbarian character has a strong sense of honor and tradition. Barbarian has close relationships with their tribe members, family members, and friends. Barbarian is used to fighting, and they see battle as a natural part of life. Barbarian isn't afraid to fight, and he isn't afraid to die. Barbarian doesn't see life as something that should be wasted."
"Dwarves were careful and deliberate, with a more serious disposition than other races, who they sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. A dwarf did all things with care and a stubborn resolve, with brash or cowardly behavior unusual for them. However, dwarves did succumb easily to wrath or greed, which were their most common vices."
"Wizard are naturally adept at combat, making them some of the most common wizard adventurers. Most evocation spells have an immediately obvious combat application, such as magic missile or fireball and make evokers valued combatants who often serve as a form of magical artillery on the battlefield."
"Elves are confident, helpful, nurturing and wise."
"A nomadic wanderer, the Barbarian combines brawn and ruggedness with a mastery of weapons, using devastating melee attacks along with war cries to boost his allies' or demoralize his enemies."
Convinced that a pick-axe is the best melee weapon.
"Barbarians are melee fighters highly trained in the arts of weaponry. These mighty warriors, strong and quick on the battlefield, depend on their heavy plate armor, shields, and battle prowess to defend themselves and ensure enemies don't focus on their softer-skinned allies. Weapon mastery is a staple of warrior training, and they are capable of delivering high damage with enormous two-handed weapons or by wielding two weapons. As barbarians deal or take damage, their rage grows, allowing them to deliver truly crushing attacks in the heat of battle."
"Fairies are incredibly powerful magical beings, being apparently all about energy."
"Barbarians are generally at peace with most species and cultures. They tend to get along with those who have warrior traditions. They are also closely tied to the natural world, so they are usually in harmony with nature."
"Faeries watch over and protect the natural world: woodlands, trees, rivers and growing things."
"Barbarians wear clothes that are rough and rugged. While many stereotypes depict barbarians as wearing nothing but a loincloth, but this is rarely true. Barbarians come from the wilds outside society, but this doesn't mean that they don't have their own sense of class and style. Some barbarian cultures favor colorful clothing and ornate jewelry."
"A dwarf advises on a matter of diplomacy. For dwarves, loyalty was more than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. Dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. Many dwarven tales subsequently revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. Just as dwarves were known for their dependability as friends and allies, dwarves also harbored grudges far longer than many other races. This might be on an individual basis between a dwarf and one who had wronged them, or against entire races, even if warfare with the enemy had long since ceased."
"Barbarians are in a constant state of physical conflict, so it's common for them to have obvious signs of past wounds. Barbarians also sometimes use scars and battle marks as tattoos, so if you have the option, you might want to avoid using the deformity rules."
"Although the Elves are more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them thus Elves do require sustenance."
