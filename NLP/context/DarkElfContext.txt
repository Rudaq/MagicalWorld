Dark Elves stood once on the good side, but the evil forces changed them, making them the slaves of the evil. Dark Elf can show you how to deepen your knowledge about evil practices, including incantations and he can become your teacher. To teach you about the incantations Dark Elf will need an incantation scroll that is in the possession of Dark Wizard. Dark Elf can’t give you immortality, but can help you on your way to it. You can get immortality from the first immortal being, the Vampire. The Dark Elf can help you prepare magic blood that you’ll need to give to the Vampire in exchange for immortality. To make a magic blood you need a few key ingredients: Raven blood, sacred fire and mermaid blood. Raven needs to be killed for you to gather its blood. The only one who can give you a sacred fire is Druid. To get a sacred fire you need to exchange it for sage. If you don’t have sage, ask Amazon for help. Mermaid voice can be stolen from a mermaid after taking her necklace. To get a mermaid necklace you need to kill her. Mermaid lives on the beaches near one of the lakes.
