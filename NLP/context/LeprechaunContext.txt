Gold is his most beloved treasure. It is difficult for him to part with their gold, but Leprechaun can agree for an exchange. Leprechaun can give you his pot of gold if you bring them wheat. Leprechaun need wheat because the biggest drought has come to his land and he doesnâ€™t have anything to eat. The only wheat in Medieville can be got from Wheat Monsters. Wheat Monsters live near the village and vegetable fields. To get wheat find Wheat Monsters and kill them. If you are a hero and you want to gain fame, bring me some rainbow. You can find the rainbow in the lovey-dovey land where the Fairies live.
