They have powerful builds, so they're able to use heavy weapons and carry lots of equipment.""Their arms tend to be long, and they have rough skin. Coming up with a good physical description for your barbarian character is important because it can help you to think about how your character's appearance will affect their behavior and outlook on life.""Barbarians wear clothes that are rough and rugged. While many stereotypes depict barbarians as wearing nothing but a loincloth, but this is rarely true. Barbarians come from the wilds outside society, but this doesn't mean that they don't have their own sense of class and style. Some barbarian cultures favor colorful clothing and ornate jewelry.""Barbarians are in a constant state of physical conflict, so it's common for them to have obvious signs of past wounds. Barbarians also sometimes use scars and battle marks as tattoos, so if you have the option, you might want to avoid using the deformity rules.""Barbarians have unkempt hair and rough facial features.

They consider their actions to be the result of the decisions that they make, and they would never seek to blame others for their decisions.""Barbarians are generally at peace with most species and cultures. They tend to get along with those who have warrior traditions. They are also closely tied to the natural world, so they are usually in harmony with nature.""It is unusual for a barbarian to worship a god. Barbarians generally find it more natural to worship a pantheon of gods or nature. Many barbarians believe that they are a living incarnation of a god. Although barbarians have no formal religion, they have a strong sense of honor and loyalty. They try to emulate their gods by living in harmony with nature and fulfilling their duties.""Barbarians are usually adventurers just because they don't really know what else to do. They have an inherent wanderlust and a desire to stand out. They have a strong sense of honor, so they often look for opportunities to prove themselves. They are natural leaders, so they often rise to leadership positions in groups.""Barbarian character has a strong sense of honor and tradition.

They like to fight, and they are able to keep their groups moving in the right direction.""These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.""For some Barbarians, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.""Barbarians are all about getting angry and dealing damage. They have a ton of hit points, resistance to damage, and Rage gives a wonderful bonus to damage. Barbarians don't get much in the way of skills, so generally they're stuck as combat monsters, but they function equally well as a defender and a striker, and certain character options can even expand them into a limited support role."The Barbarian is notoriously useless outside of combat because their class features are almost exclusively dedicated to act of violence."Barbarians are melee fighters highly trained in the arts of weaponry. These mighty warriors, strong and quick on the battlefield, depend on their heavy plate armor, shields, and battle prowess to defend themselves and ensure enemies don't focus on their softer-skinned allies. Weapon mastery is a staple of warrior training, and they are capable of delivering high damage with enormous two-handed weapons or by wielding two weapons. As barbarians deal or take damage, their rage grows, allowing them to deliver truly crushing attacks in the heat of battle.""Barbarians are usually leading the charge into battle, tearing across the battlefield and using furious shouts and terrifying banners to rally their allies and intimidate their enemies. Whether striking down opponents with mighty two-handed weapons, tearing into packs of enemies in a whirlwind of steel, or standing firm in the face of death itself, warriors excel at battle with a range of powerful attacks and battlefield maneuvers, as masters of both skillful strikes and devastating blows.""Barbarians equip themselves carefully for combat and engage their enemies head-on, letting attacks glance off their heavy armor. They use diverse combat tactics and a wide variety of weapon types to protect their more vulnerable allies. Barbarians must carefully master their rage - the power behind their strongest attacks - in order to maximize their effectiveness in combat.""Barbarian talents can improve their already considerable defenses with a shield, increase their deadliness with two-handed weapons, or bolster their savagery while dual-wielding.""Barbarians are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.""Barbarians train constantly and strive for perfection in armed combat. Though they come from all walks of life, they are united in their singular commitment to engage in glorious battle. Many warriors serve as mercenary soldiers, while others become adventurers and danger-seeking fortune hunters. A typical warrior is strong, tough, and exceptionally violent.""Combining a mastery of weapons and prowess in battle, Barbarians storm fearlessly into the front lines of any fight.""Rage is the Barbarian's defining class feature. The bonus damage isn't huge, but it's reliable and consistent. The resistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage multiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but your number of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid it.""Barbarian is a fighter, through and through. Barbarian is tough and headstrong, never giving up until his opponent is down. Barbarian is very loyal to his friends, and he uses his muscles and brawn to protect them.""Barbarian is tall and brawny. Barbarian has bright red hair, cropped short. His bright green eyes are constantly assessing his surroundings while he is out on the road. His vest is very practical, with a number of small pouches attached all around. Barbarian wears a small bag on his side, with a short sword strapped to his back.""The Barbarian is a champion, swordsman, swordswoman, soldier, and brawler who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics. Barbarians can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good Barbarian needs to be strong and healthy if they hope to survive.""Barbarians can be excellent warriors. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly throw himself into a berserk rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent. Barbarians can't use plate mail armor, unlike the other three warrior classes. They use the fighter avatar for their appearance. The Barbarian can draw from a high level ability pool which gives the barbarian some extra abilities.""Barbarian is a very friendly, outgoing person who just loves to share a good drink with anyone willing to listen. Barbarian is never afraid to speak his mind, even if it gets him in trouble. Barbarian is happy with his life as an adventurer and looks forward to seeing the world. Barbarian loves a good fight as much as the next barbarian, but he doesn't like to kill. Well, not all the time. If his life or a friend's life is in danger, he will totally destroy his enemies. He has a soft spot for other barbarians, however, even if they are from a different tribe.""Barbarian is a tall man with slightly long brown hair. He tends to wear whatever is comfortable, usually something unusual, like a cloak made from a lion's hide. Hev is not a very handsome man, but he moves with great, athletic strength. When in battle, he usually wears next to nothing, save for a metal breast-plate taken from a slain berserker. He carries a war hammer, which he forged himself from the metal of a fallen statue. He keeps his hair greasy so opponents can't get a good grip on him.""Barbarian has a scar running along the left side of his face, from his forehead down to his chin. Barbarian got this from a duel with a baby dragon that got out of hand, as his previous battle scars testify. His left ear is also slightly deformed, but he wears an earring in it. Barbarian speaks with a thick accent and swears a lot. He's a loud, boisterous man who laughs and tells stories constantly. He acts like a berserker who fights for the fun of it. Overall, his appearance tends to scare people away, and he's fine with that.""Barbarian likes his life of adventure, traveling the countryside, earning gold, and drinking. ""Barbarian has long dark hair and sharp yellow eyes. He has rough, black fur covering his body, and he has sharp fingernails and long, sharp teeth. He wears dark blue and black clothes, but he often carries around a black cloak and hood in case he needs to hide in the shadows.""Barbarian has green eyes and midnight black hair. His most distinguishing feature is the tattoo of his late mother on his left arm. He's very muscular and he has a strong, angular face. He wears hide armor and black trousers. The only weapons he requires is a small shield and a large knife.""Barbarians had a reputation, perhaps not completely deserved, as reckless ruffians and savage nuisances who needless disrupted society by acts of mayhem. However, barbarians, while undoubtedly feral and unpredictable by the nature of their rages, were not necessarily uncultured brutes. Time and time again, barbarians proved their cunning and resourcefulness as well as their sheer physical power and endurance. Sometimes, in spite of their aversion to an organized order, barbarians even demonstrated honor."Barbarian is an insulting word for a person from an uncivilized culture or a person with no manners. Barbarians aren't known for their etiquette.Barbarian is a crude uncouth ill-bred person lacking culture or refinement.This fearless warrior relies on his bulging muscles and striking mustache to wreak havoc in enemy villages. Release a horde of Barbarians and enjoy the mayhem!"Barbarians primary ability is strength, their saving throw proficiencies are strength and constitution.""A barbarian's true strength lies not in the body, but in the spirit.""A nomadic wanderer, the Barbarian combines brawn and ruggedness with a mastery of weapons, using devastating melee attacks along with war cries to boost his allies' or demoralize his enemies.""Glorified by many a song and fireside tale, the Barbarian is unrivaled in delivering unrelenting melee fury on anyone foolish enough to greet their axe-head.""The Barbarian has unparalleled strength and expertly wields an entire arsenal in battle, with a weapon for every occasion. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shaking slams to send approaching hordes reeling.""A brutal, physical warrior, the Barbarian roams around the battlefield constantly, dishing heavy damage and wielding an array of powerful weapons with ease.""Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.""Barbarians are mighty warriors who relied on their strength and incredible toughness, characterized by a bestial rage empowered either by ancestral totems and nature spirits or an inner passion for violence. Barbarians were less versatile than fighters but were tougher and capable of dealing heavy damage to their foes much more quickly.""Barbarian is a creature class. Barbarians, are warriors who have sworn their service and their lives to a single authority figure, usually a feudal lord.""Most barbarians are noble and serve their duty unflinchingly. Barbarians are often equipped with a long sword and a short sword in many lands where barbarians are found, they are the only citizens allowed to carry more than one weapon. The ability, representing their power in combat, is exclusive to barbarians. Most barbarians are aligned with white.""Barbarian is a creature class. They are tough and disciplined, adept at fighting in concert, and overwhelming the enemy.""Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.""Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.""Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.""Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.""Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. ""Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 1.3 - 1.45 meters on average, with gold dwarves a bit shorter. What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk""Dwarves were a long-lived race, though not so much as elves, and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she reached age fifty. Dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer period of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 years. Most dwarves lived to see their bicentennial and a few lived to be over 400. A dwarf was considered to be young until they reached the age of 50.""Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes. Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity.""A dwarf advises on a matter of diplomacy. For dwarves, loyalty was more than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. Dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. Many dwarven tales subsequently revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. Just as dwarves were known for their dependability as friends and allies, dwarves also harbored grudges far longer than many other races. This might be on an individual basis between a dwarf and one who had wronged them, or against entire races, even if warfare with the enemy had long since ceased.""Dwarves were careful and deliberate, with a more serious disposition than other races, who they sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. A dwarf did all things with care and a stubborn resolve, with brash or cowardly behavior unusual for them. However, dwarves did succumb easily to wrath or greed, which were their most common vices.""Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as halflings or gnomes, though this was not a trait common to all dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely unsocial and more than a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, something that sat well with their legendary crafting abilities.""Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with.

Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes.  Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity.""Dwarves could see in the dark, out to about 60 feet (18 meters). Many dwarves had an affinity for the caverns in which they lived, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could seem almost supernatural at times.""Likewise, dwarves, perhaps moreso than most other races, turned to their gods for guidance and protection.Dwarves looked to the divine for comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for methods through which to obtain power over others. Individual dwarves might be faithless, but the race as a whole, regardless of subrace, had a strong inclination for religion and almost every community maintained at least one temple or ancestral shrine.""Most dwarven clans focused on one or two kinds of crafting, such as blacksmithing, jewelry, engineering, or masonry. Dwarves strove to avoid overspecialization by sending some of their youths to other clans to serve as apprentices, which also helped to foster racial unity. Because of their longevity, these apprenticeships might last decades.""Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface in the mountains, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did.""Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than goblins but much broader and heavier. Most Dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts.""They seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle their soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and styles that were trademarks of Dwarven crafting styles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon.""They had a knack for starting a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything. Although they knew how, Dwarves did not farm or herd often, as they preferred to spend their time underground mining and crafting. They rather traded crafted items with Men and Elves in exchange for food.""They were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithying skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the Elves, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The skill of the Dwarves was unmatched they crafted objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Everything Dwarven was beautifully crafted and intricate. They crafted many famed weapons, armors, and items of art and beauty.""Dwarves were taught special skills and spent most of their time crafting, smithying and mining in their massive underground cities.""Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than Men, often up to two-hundred-and-fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone.""Dwarves were firm believers in the righteousness of their own ways, yet were surprisingly tolerant of the cultures of others, much of which was due to their natural introversion. Polite dwarves normally declined to speak their minds about others regardless of their true feelings""Dwarves are stocky, bearded, never bald, especially hardy and loyal, stubborn."Dwarves are shorter than Men."Their hair can be blond, brown, black, blue, red, and (when older) grey or white.""As a weapon they very often use axes, swords, hammers, mattocks.""Long time ago, the dwarves made alliances with the elves, and both prospered from trade.""Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to friends and family. They treat and care for each other, even strangers among their kind like family. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and gems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the elves. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often seen as greedy, but their nature gave them resistance to many external influences. ""Dwarven soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because it can be used as a tool or a weapon, but in addition to axes they used hatchets, mattocks, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionally there is mention of dwarven archers.""As for armor, Dwarves favored chain-mail and other metallic armor where the most expensive and precious of which was ring mail made of gold.""Dwarves are a short but stocky race that inhabits Frozen Empire. What a regular dwarf lacks in in height (measuring between 4 and 5 feet), he makes up for in bulk, weighing as much as a mature human. Dwarven males are a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts.""Dwarves are unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, are resistant to virtually all poisons and it takes less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also have dense bodies and are difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads, that other races might find hindering, with little ill effect.""Many dwarves have an affinity for the caverns in which they live, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could almost seem supernatural at times. They are also renowned for their metalworking and crafting abilities."All dwarfs have beards and wear up to twelve layers of clothing.

Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.""Elves are generally considered one of the most beautiful races. They are slightly shorter and more delicate than humans and are not as hardy. Elves are a rare sight on the sword coast perhaps because they prefer the wild to human cities. While they are well known as a cheerful and frolicsome race, many elves, especially drow, are as surly as dwarves or as prideful as humans."Elves are said to have the most beautiful voices of all kinds. This makes them highly sought after by bards."Elves tend to be taller and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones.

Males taller than females.Some elves tend to have a more powerful and muscular build than other elves."The elves are deeply in tune with the flow of aether and the subtle ways it influences and shapes the natural world. Their inventions are inspired by nature and in turn they inspire others, offering a vision of progress that is elegant, efficient, and harmonious with the aether patterns. ""Unlike other elves, Dark Elves are a brutal race of supremacists who hide their savagery behind a facade of beauty and sophistication.

They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to.""Elves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary.""Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races. Elves were agile, dexterous creatures. However, elves could move slightly faster than their eladrin kin and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Elves were also more preternaturally aware of their surroundings than eladrin, as well as possessing better common sense. This aided elves in many ways, allowing elves a high degree of perceptiveness that they could lend partially to allies. Additionally, elves were extremely accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids.""Elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, though they were not usually considered past adolescence until they reached 110 years of age. Unlike humans, elves did not age dramatically as their lifespan came to a close, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening.

Even when he doesn't have all the answers, he will try to act like he knows what he's doing, so that the others will look up to him for leadership. He especially likes to eat delicious pastry foods made by the local elf.""Elf has dark-brown hair that is slightly tousled. He also has light-green eyes, a fair complexion, and two Elf Tattoos - one, a green zigzag on his cheek, and the other, the earth insignia (a leaf with three points) on his shoulder.""She was banished to the Specular Waters by her closest friend, and can now only speak through the waters of Specular Fountain. Supposedly, her friend created the Specular Waters as a gift for her, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. She has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. The Legend of she is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as she prepares to put her schemes into motion, the land of elves will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real.""Elf has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead.""As a Dark Elf, her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom.""Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.""Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder. Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies. Elves are glamorous. They project glamour. Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment. Elves are terrific. They beget terror. The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. No one ever said elves are nice. Elves are bad.""Dark elves actively hunt humans, just as they hunt deer and bears in the forest. Some call themselves knights, though the Realm would not recognize them as such. They ride giant foxes and wolves so they can bound through dense forests faster than any horse."Elves are generally liked and even admired by humans and are easily accepted into their society. The same cannot be said for dwarves some of whom despise elves on principle."Winged elves have feathered wings and are capable of flight. They are more delicate than their earth-bound cousins, with hollow bones to aid their flight. They have pale skin and slightly larger than normal eyes.""Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease."Elves are immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair."Elves are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. ""Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable. Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown.""Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.""Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.""Faerie is a mythical being of romance usually having magic powers. It can appear as a creature typically having bright, shining clothes and hair."Freckles are really just the kisses of faeries."Faeries love honey cake, milk, nectar, and sweet butter.""Faeries watch over and protect the natural world: woodlands, trees, rivers and growing things."Many faeries like to play practical (and sometimes not-so-practical) jokes on humans and even each other."A sudden chill breeze, or ripples across the surface of water, are often indications that a faerie is nearby."Faeries can live to be hundreds of years old."Faerie is creature type used for cards that depict creatures with human appearance, often small stature, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery.""The earliest, and most common, faerie in Lovey-dovey Land are winged humanoid creatures of diminutive size (sometimes a foot in height or smaller) that are renowned for being great lovers of mischief. These faeries exist through the multiverse. These are also sometimes known as fae, pixies or sprites.""Faeries collect unusually valuable things: coins of fallen empires, baby teeth, and memories of treasured name.""Faeries can be carelessly cruel, capricious, and vindictive. It is thought that faeries do not dream, which would explain why they spend so much time harvesting the dreams of others. Faeries can distill these stolen dreams into sparkling energy that they carry around with them.""Faeries are magical by nature and live in magical, pink biom."The oldest and strongest faeries are fallen angels.Faeries are quick to do you a favor and even quicker to demand payment for it."Some faeries are helpful. They guide travelers who are lost in the forest back towards home. They help with household chores, often going to work overnight, so that their hosts wake up to a happy surprise. If they are particularly fond of you, they might even lead you to treasure, give you magical gifts, help you win your true love hand in marriage, or cast a lucky charm over your life.""Bad faeries are mischievous. They delight in misleading travelers or luring them into exhausting dances that go one for days. They also like to taunt domestic animals, pinching horses to make them gallop, stealing milk from cows, and playing cat-and-mouse with cats.""It's important to be aware that most faeries have fluid personalities. They can go from helpful to mischievous quickly, and despite their cleverness, they don't have to have a reason for their decisions!""As magical creatures, faeries have almost unlimited power. They can fly. They can make flowers bloom. They can conjure up gold. They can glow in the dark. They can create and cast new charms for any situation, and their curses can last for hundreds of years.""Faeries come in many forms, and have been described as magical and mischievous beings from the realm next door. This realm is considered another dimension or reality. Faeries have been classified into two groups - one consisting of light faeries and the other dark ones. However, there have not been many details about identifying faerie classes.""Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality, dark faeries are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal.""The most common faeries are associated with one of the six elements. The elemental faeries can control the forces of earth, air, water, light, fire and darkness.""As time typically flows differently for them and in their realm, they are very long-lived and become only more artful and powerful as they age, though they are not immortal.""Faeries are known for their cunning and their cruel sense of humor, and they especially delight in tricking other creatures. Therefore, even though their land is beautiful, hardly anyone goes there. They frequently seek to bargain with others, offering someone their heart's desire but failing to mention that the desire comes with a terrible cost. They are committed to notions of honor and etiquette, and while faeries always exactly follow the letter of any promise they have made, they deliver these results with great irony and often use clever wordplay to their advantage in order to create loopholes."Some faeries have the ability to send someone pleasant dreams. It is considered a faerie gift."Faeries have long life spans, longer than other mortals and have the ability to choose when they die. They don't migrate to other lands."Faeries are strongly magical and some of them are even immortal.Faeries are magical beings."Faeries appear to be sensitive to energy, as one of them made the comment that fairies are all about energy.""Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality they are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal.""Fairies are incredibly powerful magical beings, being apparently all about energy.""Faeries can only be seen if they want to be. This ability continues to work, even after the fairy in question's death, meaning humans who haven't been to the fairy realm can't see their remains.""Faeries specialize in the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or a far away location. Faeries are notable for possessing an unusually high wisdom from wizards, with strong and cautious judgment, preferring to use violence only as a last resort. Many faeries are also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all matters.""Faeries are not necessarily cowards but exhaust all other options before proceeding into combat. While faeries can be useful due to their anticipation of others' attacks some are irritatingly hesitant, making them nigh useless at times. When forced into battle, faeries are in natural opposition to illusionists, whose tricks they can unravel with their own spells.""Some fairies, even some of the most ugly and horrifying, can be benevolent and helpful. Other fairies can be evil and malicious, even some of the most beautiful. What they have in common is that all fairies are considered to be both mischievous and capricious. They love to play tricks and their attitude can change from happy or friendly to ferocious without warning if they are somehow offended.""Wizard's soul is inundated with power.Wizards are a type of magic user. Athletic, affable, and self-assured, wizards hardly seem like scholarly bibliophiles hidden away from civilization. They possess many of the same skills as the male members of the magic clans, but excel at the use of elemental magic.""Wizard is a battle-ready warrior for whom faith is a shield, and fights for what he believes to be right. His steadfastness gives him powers to bestow blessings to his friends and wreak cruel justice on foes. There are those who call the wizard an overwrought zealot, but others recognize in him the strength and goodness of the light.""Wizards work with their allies more closely than some of the more single-minded wizard variants and this is one of their strengths. Wizards use their spells to overcome social obstacles, convince enemies to lay down arms, or put foes into a daze. The most dangerous ability of an wizard is their ability to turn an enemy into an ally, or vice versa, or to incapacitate an enemy in such a way that renders them as good as dead.""Wizards can be good or evil and have no overall strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters are chaotic over evil, though only by a slim margin. Good wizards are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another's being's free will, while evil enchanters show little such restraint.""Wizard's magic is a unique blend of arcane magic with the elemental power of creation and those who specialize in it are known as evokers. Wizards are often stubbornly determined by nature and have little use for distractions of the real world, living in very often spartan conditions. Many wizards are decisive and forthright, who are sure of what they must do, be it good or evil, giving them many qualities of strong leadership.""Wizard are naturally adept at combat, making them some of the most common wizard adventurers. Most evocation spells have an immediately obvious combat application, such as magic missile or fireball and make evokers valued combatants who often serve as a form of magical artillery on the battlefield.""Wizards were a form of a spellcaster who learned the art of arcane magic through research and learning.  What wizards lacked in combat prowess and armor they made up with a broad range of magical spells and abilities learned through years of practice and training. Through their spellcasting ability, powerful wizards could control the battlefield, using spells that affected wide areas, often hindering enemies, while also learning to use powerful rituals of arcane power.""Wizards often used arcane accessories, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands. These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically.""Wizards were also skilled in the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells which a wizard can only master once per day), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual.""Wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. In particular, they learn most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their spellbooks, a method that allows them, unlike bards or sorcerers, to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards see themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, and scientists, studying a system of natural laws that are for the most part unknown and undiscovered.""Specialist wizards are treated and regarded as wizards by the world at large in spite of this specialization and many regarded themselves as such, though sometimes distinctions are made for diviners, illusionists, and necromancers. ""Wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or interact with other spells, are known as abjurers. These wizards are usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. They like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters.""Stereotypes of faeries and wizards are often similar, they tend to see magic as a blunt instrument. In battle, they do tend to be unflinching in danger, confident in their summoned power to overcome any threat.""Most of wizards like isolation, as it means they can carry out their dangerous experiments undisturbed by others and only leave their enclaves either to accumulate more power or the necessary wealth to continue their research.""Wizards wear only cloth armor, but compensate for this with a range of armor spells, wreathing themselves in flame, frost or even arcane energies. Nonetheless, when fighting melee opponents, wizards stay alive by incapacitating attackers and always keeping one step ahead - and well out of reach. Wizards are quick and can blink away from attackers, use invisibility to slip into the shadows. Wizards are masters of kiting, and can use their enviable range of snares and crowd control abilities to defeat whole groups of opponents without putting a hair out of place."A Wizard gains their spellcasting power by making a deal with a demon or another dark being."A number of black-aligned spellcrafters are called wizards (though some are shamans instead of wizards). Some are necromancers, others make demonic pacts.""Wizards can utilize their skill to ensure that enemies focus on them, defending weaker members of their group. Their potent healing abilities ensure that their allies remain in fighting shape and can be resurrect, while they charge their weapons with holy might, allowing them to deal additional damage with their strikes. As champions of order, wizards are extremely potent in a group - their blessings and auras can improve damage and survivability for both themselves and their party, while withstanding heavy physical damage with plate armor and strong defensive abilities.""Wizards talents increase their ability to heal the wounded, strengthen their capacity to protect their companions, and allow them to deal out vicious damage in the name of justice.""Wizard's purpose is to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. The light grants wizards additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer.""Wizards are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the light would shine upon. The light radiates from wizards, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power.""Wizards do battle to protect the world from the forces of shadow. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the light to heal wounds, create shields of force, and incinerate evil creatures. " Wizards are champions who call upon the light to heal wounds and combat evil."Wizards are bastions of divine light, meting out justice with magic and might.""Wizards do battle to spread the shadows into the world. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the evil creatures and shadows which would serve them in the battle."Wizards are dark avengers who call upon the darkness to spread evil and conquer the world."Wizards are hosts of dark forces, sowing pestilence and horror." 'Barbarians come in many different shapes and sizes, but most tend to be taller and more muscular than other classes. They have faces that make them look intense and beastly. They are of strong stature, so they can use heavy weapons and carry a lot of equipment.'   'Your arms tend to be long and have rough skin. Finding a good physical description of your barbaric character is important because it can help you think about how the appearance of your character will affect your behaviour and attitude towards life.'   'Barbarians wear clothes that are rough and craggy. While many stereotypes show that barbarians wear nothing but a loincloth, this is rarely the case. Barbarians come from the wilderness outside society, but that does not mean that they lack their own sense of class and style. Some barbaric cultures prefer colorful clothing and ornate jewelry.'   'Barbarians are in a constant state of physical conflict, so it is common for them to have clear signs of past wounds. Barbarians sometimes also use scars and battle marks as tattoos, so if you have the opportunity, you should avoid the deformity rules.'   'Barbarians have unkempt hair and rough features. Generally, they have a deep forehead, protruding nose and thin lips. Shaggy hair and unkempt beard are common.'   'Barbarians have tough, thick skin and sometimes scars. They often have a healthy tan.'   'Barbarians have long, messy hair. Sometimes they have beards. They are also a few characters who are allowed to wear their hair long.'   'There is no cultural norm for hair color, but most barbarians have dark hair or hair that is dark at the roots and light at the ends.'   'Although there is no cultural norm for eye color, most barbarians have dark eyes.'   'Barbarians have a strong sense of community and honor. They are proud and believe in living as close to nature as possible. Barbarians are also traditionalists. They respect the traditions of the past, especially those associated with war and struggle.'   'Barbarians have a sense of duty and honor, and they follow a strict code. They regard their actions as the result of the decisions they make, and they would never seek to blame others for their decisions.'   'Barbarians generally live in peace with most species and cultures. They tend to get along with those who have warrior traditions. They are also closely connected with the natural world and are therefore generally in harmony with nature.'   'Barbarians generally find it more natural to worship a pantheon of gods or nature. Many barbarians believe that they are a living incarnation of a god. Although barbarians have no formal religion, they have a strong sense of honor and loyalty and try to emulate their gods by living in harmony with nature and fulfilling their duties.'   "Barbarians tend to be more adventurous simply because they don't really know what else to do. They have an innate wanderlust and desire to stand out. They have a strong sense of honor, so they often look for opportunities to prove themselves. They are natural leaders and therefore often rise to leadership positions in groups."   'Barbarian has a strong sense of honor and tradition. Barbarian has close relations with his tribesmen, family members and friends. Barbarian is used to fighting, and they see fighting as a natural part of life. Barbarian is not afraid to fight, and he is not afraid to die. Barbarian does not see life as something to be wasted.'   'Barbarians have a sense of community and responsibility. Barbarians are loyal to their friends and family, and they have a duty to protect the weak and the innocent. Barbarians are used to adapting to dangerous situations and taking care of themselves. Barbarians have seen terrible things, but they choose to keep fighting to protect others.'   'Barbarian is a traditionalist. Barbarian has a strong sense of duty and honour and follows a strict code. Barbarian regards his actions as the result of the decisions he makes, and he would never seek to blame others for his decisions.'   'Barbarian characters have a strong sense of honor and duty. They are often the leaders of their groups. They are often used to being in dangerous situations, and they are good group leaders because they are used to dealing with difficult situations. They like to fight and are able to move their groups in the right direction.'   'These barbarians, however different they may be, are defined by their anger: unbridled, insatiable and thoughtless anger. Their anger is more than mere emotion, it is the cruelty of a cornered predator, the relentless assault of a storm, the stirring tumult of the sea.'   'For some barbarians, their anger stems from their fellowship with ferocious animal spirits. For every barbarian, anger is a power that fuels not only a frenzy of combat, but also sinister reflexes, resilience, and exploits.'   "Barbarians are about getting angry and doing damage. They have a lot of hit points, resistance to damage and anger gives a wonderful bonus for damage. Barbarians don't have much skill, so they're generally stuck as combat monsters, but they work equally well as defenders and strikers, and certain character options can even extend them to a limited supporting role."   'The barbarians are notoriously useless outside the fight, because their class characteristics are almost exclusively devoted to acts of violence.'   'These powerful warriors, strong and fast on the battlefield, rely on their heavy tanks, shields and fighting power to defend themselves and ensure that enemies do not focus on their soft-skinned allies. Mastery of weapons is a staple of warrior training, and they are capable of inflicting heavy damage with enormous two-handed weapons or by running two weapons. The more barbarians cause or take, the greater their anger, enabling them to carry out truly devastating attacks in the heat of battle.'   "Usually, barbarians lead the attack into battle, sweeping across the battlefield, using angry cries and fearsome banners to rally their allies and intimidate their enemies. Whether it's crushing enemies with powerful two-handed weapons, tearing enemies apart in a whirlwind of steel, or standing firm in the face of death itself, warriors stand out for a series of powerful attacks and battlefield maneuvers, mastering both dexterous blows and devastating blows."   'Barbarians are carefully gearing up for battle, fighting their enemies head-on and letting attacks flash from their heavy armor, using different combat tactics and a variety of weapon types to protect their more vulnerable allies. Barbarians must carefully control their anger - the force behind their strongest attacks - to maximize their effectiveness in combat.'   'Barbarian talents can enhance their already considerable defense with a shield, increase their lethality with two-handed weapons, or increase their brutality while acting with two hands.'   'Barbarians are the epitome of fearless warriors on the battlefield, and their sheer fighting power inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Expert in melee weapons of all kinds, and with incredible physical strength and dexterity, warriors are perfect for serving as front-line warriors and field commanders.'   'Barbarians train constantly and strive for perfection in armed combat. Although they come from all walks of life, they are united by their unique commitment to glorious battles. Many warriors serve as mercenaries, while others become adventurers and dangerous fortune hunters. A typical warrior is strong, tough and exceptionally violent.'   'By combining weapon mastery and combat power, the barbarians fearlessly storm to the forefront of every battle.'   "Anger is the barbarian's class trait. Bonus damage is not huge, but it is reliable and durable. Damage resistance makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage several times in the same encounter when you absolutely need it, but your number of tantrums per day is limited, so don't try if you can avoid it."   'Barbarian is a fighter through and through. Barbarian is tough and stubborn and never gives up until his opponent is on the ground. Barbarian is very loyal to his friends and uses his muscles to protect them.'   'Barbarian is tall and beefy. Barbarian has light red, short cropped hair. His bright green eyes constantly assess his surroundings while he is out and about. His vest is very practical, with a number of small pockets all around. Barbarian carries a small pocket on the side, a short sword strapped to his back.'   'The barbarian is a champion, swordsman, swordsman, soldier and brawler who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics. Barbarians can be found at the front of every battle and fight from head to toe with monsters and villains. A good barbarian must be strong and healthy if he wants to survive.'   'Barbarians can be superb warriors. Although not as disciplined or skillful as a normal warrior, the barbarian can readily plunge into a berserk-like rage and become a tougher and stronger opponent. Barbarians, unlike the other three warrior classes, cannot use plate armor. They use the warrior avatar for their appearance. The barbarian can draw from a high-level skill pool that gives the barbarian some additional abilities.'   'Barbarian is a very friendly, open-minded person who simply loves to share a good drink with anyone who is willing to listen. Barbarian is never afraid to speak his mind, even if it gets him into trouble. Barbarian is happy with his life as an adventurer and is looking forward to seeing the world. Barbarian loves a good fight just like the next barbarian, but he does not like to kill. Well, not all the time. If his life or that of a friend is in danger, he will completely destroy his enemies. However, he has a soft spot for other barbarians, even if they belong to a different tribe.'   'Barbarian is a tall man with slightly long brown hair. He tends to wear anything that is comfortable, usually something unusual, like a coat of lion fur. Hev is not a particularly handsome man, but he moves with great athletic strength. When he is in combat, he usually wears next to nothing except a metal breastplate taken from a slain Berserker. He carries a war hammer he forged from the metal of a fallen statue. He keeps his hair greasy so that opponents do not get a good grip on him.'   'Barbarian has a scar that runs along the left side of his face, from forehead to chin. Barbarian has this scar from a fight with a baby dragon that got out of control, as his previous battle scars testify. His left ear is also slightly deformed, but he wears an earring in it. Barbarian speaks with a thick accent and swears a lot. He is a loud, boisterous man who constantly laughs and tells stories. He behaves like a mountaineer who struggles to enjoy it.'   'Barbarian loves his adventurous life, travels through the countryside, earns gold and drinks.'   'Barbarian has long dark hair and sharp yellow eyes.

He wears dark blue and black clothing, but he often carries a black coat and a black hood in case he has to hide in the shade.'   'Barbarian has green eyes and midnight black hair. His most striking feature is the tattoo of his deceased mother on his left arm. He is very muscular and has a strong, angular face. He wears leather armor and black pants. The only weapons he needs are a small shield and a large knife.'   'Barbarians had a reputation, perhaps not entirely deserved, as ruthless villains and savage troublemakers who unnecessarily disrupted society through chaos. Barbarians were undoubtedly wild and unpredictable, but not necessarily uncultivated animals. Again and again, barbarians demonstrated their cunning and ingenuity, as well as their sheer physical power and endurance. Sometimes, barbarians, despite their aversion to organized order, even showed honor.'   'Barbarian is an offensive word for a person from an uncivilized culture or a person without manners. Barbarians are not known for their etiquette.'   'Barbarian is a clumsy, clumsy, badly bred person who lacks culture or sophistication.'   'This fearless warrior uses his bulging muscles and striking mustache to wreak havoc in enemy villages. Release a horde of barbarians and enjoy the chaos!'   'The primary skill of the Barbarians is strength, their saving throwing skills are strength and constitution.'   'The true strength of a barbarian is not in the body, but in the mind.'   'As a nomadic wanderer, the barbarian combines ruggedness and ruggedness with a mastery of weapons, using devastating melee attacks along with cries of war to strengthen his allies or demoralize his enemies.'   'Glorified by many song and fire stories, the barbarian is unrivaled in exerting relentless melee wrath on anyone foolish enough to greet his axe head.'   'The barbarian possesses unparalleled strength and uses an entire arsenal in combat, with one weapon for every occasion. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shattering slams to set approaching hordes reeling.'   'As a brutal, physical warrior, the barbarian constantly roams the battlefield, inflicting severe damage, and wielding a range of powerful weapons with ease.'   'Barbarians come alive in the chaos of battle. They can enter a Berserbian state in which anger prevails, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can only use this reservoir of anger a few times without resting, but these few rages are usually enough to defeat any emerging threats.'   'Barbarians are mighty warriors who relied on their strength and incredible toughness, characterized by a savage rage reinforced either by ancestral totems and nature spirits or an inner passion for violence. Barbarians were less versatile than warriors, but tougher and able to inflict serious damage on their enemies much more quickly.'   'Barbarians are warriors who have sworn their service and life to a single authority figure, usually a feudal lord.'   'Most barbarians are noble and do their duty steadfastly. In many countries where barbarians live, barbarians are often armed with a long sword and a short sword; they are the only citizens allowed to carry more than one weapon. The ability to represent their power in battle is reserved exclusively to barbarians.'   'Barbarians are a creature class. They are tough and disciplined, skillful in common combat and overwhelm the enemy.'   'Daring and robust dwarfs are known as skillful warriors, miners and workers of stone and metal. Although they are significantly less than 5 feet tall, dwarfs are so wide and compact that they can weigh as much as a human who is almost 2 feet taller.'   'Dwarfs "skin ranges from dark brown to a lighter, reddish hue, but the most common shades are light brown or dark brown, such as certain earth tones. Their hair, long but worn in simple styles, is usually black, gray or brown, although pale dwarfs often have red hair. Male dwarfs greatly appreciate their beard and care for it carefully.'   "Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, keeping their word and acting decisively, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget the injustice they have suffered. An injustice done to a dwarf is an injustice done to the entire dwarf clan, so that a dwarf's hunt for revenge can become a full-blown clan feud."   'Dwarves in other countries are typically craftsmen, especially armourers, armourers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, much in demand for their courage and loyalty.'   'Dwarves who lead adventurous lives may be motivated by a desire for treasure for their own sake, for a particular purpose, or even by an altruistic desire to help others.'   'Dwarfs were, as their name implies, a short race, averaging between 1.3 and 1.45 meters tall, with the golden dwarfs being slightly shorter. What the dwarves lacked in height, they made up for in masses.'   'Dwarfs were a long-lived breed, though not as much as elves, and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she was fifty years old. Dwarfs aged similarly to humans, but over a longer period of time, and remained energetic well over 150 years. Most dwarfs reached two hundred years of age and some reached over 400 years of age. A dwarf was considered young until their fifties.'   'Whether the dwarves "claim that they were carved from the stone of the world was true or not, dwarves shared many qualities similar to the stone with which they lived. Strong, robust, and dependable dwarves were courteous, especially to the elders, and possessed wisdom that transcended that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the substance from which they came, and sought inspiration from ancestral heroes. Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits that were widespread among dwarves, but that helped balance through their bravery and tenacity.'   'Dwarves believed it was a gift and a mark of respect to stand by a friend in battle, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. As a result, many dwarven stories revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. Just as dwarves were known for their reliability as friends and allies, dwarves held grudges much longer than many other races. This can happen on an individual basis between a dwarf and one who wronged them, or against entire races, even if the war with the enemy had long since ended.'   'Dwarves were cautious and cautious, with a more serious attitude than other races, which they sometimes regarded as careless or reckless. A dwarf did everything with care and tenacious determination, with an unusual brazen or cowardly behavior. Nevertheless, dwarves easily succumbed to the anger or greed that were their most common vices.'   'Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races such as halflings or gnomes, though not all dwarves had this in common and some of them had great charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely anti-social, and quite a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, which suited their legendary craftsmanship.'   'Whether the dwarves "claim that they were carved from the stone of the world was true or not, dwarves shared many qualities similar to the stone with which they lived. Strong, robust, and dependable dwarves were courteous, especially to the elders, and possessed wisdom that transcended that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the substance from which they came, and sought inspiration from ancestral heroes. Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits that were widespread among dwarves, but that helped balance through their bravery and tenacity.'   'Dwarfs could see up to 18 meters in the dark. Many dwarfs had an affinity for the caves in which they lived and had a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in the masonry that could sometimes appear almost supernatural.'   'Similarly, the dwarves, perhaps more than most other races, turned to their gods to guide and protect them. The dwarves looked to the Divine for comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for ways to gain power over others. Individual dwarves may be unbelievers, but the race as a whole, regardless of their subordination, had a strong inclination to religion, and almost every community maintained at least one temple or ancestral shrine.'   'Most dwarf clans focused on one or two types of crafts, such as blacksmithing, jewelry, mechanical engineering, or masonry. Dwarves tried to avoid over-specialization by sending some of their youths to other clans to work as apprentices, which also helped foster ethnic unity. Due to their longevity, these apprenticeships could take decades.'   'Most dwarves preferred to live in underground cities near the surface, in the mountains built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved in stone, these cities could take centuries, but when completed they were practically ageless. Although dwarves were by nature a warrior race, these cities had civilian populations that accounted for about a quarter of the total population, and consisted primarily of young, old, or a few ordinary adults.'   'Dwarves were a short, stocky breed, slightly larger than goblins, but much wider and heavier. Most dwarves had thick, luscious beards of which they were very proud, often forking or braiding and tucking into their belts.'   'They seem to have preferred simple durable clothing, colored hoods and heavy capes for travel and belts made of gold or silver. For combat, their soldiers would have worn elaborately crafted armor and helmets with different angles and styles, which were hallmarks of dwarf craftsmanship. Their armor was masked with symbols (similar to those used in forging to protect the eyes) that were hideous to look at.'   'Although they knew how to make fire, the dwarves did not often cultivate or guard it, preferring to spend their time underground mining and handicrafts, but trading artisanal items with humans and elves in exchange for food.'   'They were also skilled masons and blacksmiths - dwarven blacksmiths, it was said, competed only with the elves, and their masonry creations were unsurpassed by anyone else. Dwarfs "skills were second to none, they made objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. All dwarves were beautifully crafted and intricate, and they made many famous weapons, armor, and art and beauty items.'   'Dwarves were taught special skills and spent most of their time crafting, blacksmithing, and mining in their huge underground cities.'   'Dwarves were a proud and austere race, destined to be robust to withstand the perils of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in their ability to withstand heat and cold, and made heavy loads light. Dwarves lived longer than humans, often up to two hundred and fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to quickly learn new craftsmanship skills, especially when dealing with metal or stone.'   'Dwarves firmly believed in the righteousness of their own ways, but were surprisingly tolerant of others "cultures, owing largely to their natural introversion. Polite dwarves usually refused to express their opinion of others regardless of their true feelings.'   'Dwarfs are stocky, bearded, never bald, especially hardy and loyal, stubborn.'   'Dwarfs are shorter than humans.'   'Your hair can be blonde, brown, black, blue, red and (in old age) grey or white.'   'They often use axes, swords, hammers and mats as weapons.'   'Long ago, the dwarves formed alliances with the elves, and both prospered through trade.'   'Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to friends and family, treating and nurturing each other, even strangers among their peers like the family. Mining, handicrafts, crafts, gold, and precious stones, the acquisition of which often fueled the elves "envy, were very important to them. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments and tended to hold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often considered greedy, but their nature gave them resistance to many outside influences.'   'Dwarven soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because they could be used as a tool or weapon, but in addition to axes they used hatchets, mats, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionally there is talk of dwarven archers.'   'In terms of armor, the dwarves preferred chain mail and other metallic armor, the most expensive and valuable of which was gold ring mail.'   'Dwarfs are a short but stocky breed that inhabits the Frozen Empire. What a normal dwarf lacks in size (he measures between 4 and 5 feet), he compensates in large quantities and weighs as much as a mature human. Dwarf males are slightly larger and heavier than their female counterparts.'   'Dwarfs are unusually tough for humanoids in several ways. Dwarf stomachs, for example, are resistant to virtually all poisons, and it takes less effort for a dwarf to get back on his feet than other races. Dwarfs also have a dense body and are, as a result, difficult to move, and they are able to carry loads that other races might find obstructive without causing much damage.'   'Many dwarves have an affinity for the caves in which they live, and have a knack for spotting unusual patterns in masonry that can sometimes seem almost supernatural, and are also known for their metalworking and craftsmanship skills.'   'All dwarves have beards and wear up to twelve layers of clothing. Gender is more or less voluntary.'   'Dwarf is obsessed with finding Rupees. He will hold a handful of Rupees over a chest full of gold every day.'   'Dwarf secretly hates beer because it is too bitter. Dwarf drinks rum instead.'   'Dwarfs are very attracted to halflings, much more so than other dwarfs, but they would never let their parents know.'   'Dwarf constantly "chalks" her hands with dirt or dust from stones to improve her grip on her weapon.'   'Dwarf is afraid of orcs, but does humanly everything to deny this.'   'Dwarf cannot allow a daring or a little thing against his courage to slip past him. He always bites when someone calls him a chicken.'   'They like to shout "Heigh Ho" to themselves; when asked why, they vehemently deny it and say, "I wasn\'t."'   'Dwarf is obsessed with finding ore and gems during the adventure, and has personalised metal spikes.'   'Dwarf has ornate metal bands adorning her beard, made of brass and bronze, decorated as a tribute to the adventures they have been on so far. Dwarf always carries a small personal ale barrel with him in case of emergencies. Dwarf is busy filling it immediately after emptying, and has 4 servings of ale ready.'   'Dwarfs grimace and complain if they have been out for too long and have not been in a cave, mine or other underground area for more than 8 days.'   'Records of the giants they killed with notches in the axe or the handle of the war hammer.'   "Dwarf can't understand complicated plans, or they refuse to try. It should be plain and simple, otherwise he will drool or something like that."   'Dwarf refuses to wear or carry weapons and armor that are not dwarfs.'   'Zwerg likes to read history, especially about heroes and battles that are often overlooked in traditional history books.'   'Dwarf hates heights and actively avoids climbing unless he has to.'   'Dwarf is petrified of open water, Dwarf cannot swim.'   "Dwarf's skin is so rough that he can light a match on any part of his body."   'Dwarf tries to wrestle animals before hitting them with a gun.'   'Dwarf has an intense fascination for plants. He likes flowers most, with a special interest for lilies.'   'Dwarf gathers random animal ingredients, herbs, spices and other unique ingredients in an attempt to make the best ale in the world.'   'Dwarf secretly appreciates weapons made by elves and dreams of learning from an elf blacksmith.'   'Honor their deep dwarf roots by lighting the end of their braids or moustache before battle to intimidate enemies.'   'Regrets to have served her old god and looks for a new one.'   'Treats all dwarfs and halflings like dwarf babies.'   'Dwarf is an avid wrestler, both for the sport and for the scripted spectacle. He knows all underground wrestlers and knows where / when the biggest fights will take place. He takes every chance he gets.'   'Dwarfs are very similar to humans, but shorter. Many males have long beards and live in mines, although some of them are known to live outside the mountains and even on islands.'   't believe in orcs. He believes that these are just tall people who work.'   'Protects women with far more bravery than men, even if he is risking his own life.'   'Dwarves are solid and persevering like the mountains they love, surviving the course of the centuries with stoic perseverance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans and trace their ancestry back to the founding of their oldest strongholds in the youth of the world and do not give up these traditions lightly. Part of these traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarf ideals of hard work, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.'   'Elves are generally considered one of the most beautiful breeds. They are a little shorter and tender than humans and not as hardy. Elves are a rare sight on the Sword Coast, perhaps because they prefer the wilderness to human cities. Although they are known as a joyful and boisterous race, many elves, especially drowning ones, are as grumpy as dwarves or as proud as humans.'   'Elves are said to have the most beautiful voices of all kinds, which makes them highly desired by bards.'   'Elves are usually taller and slimmer than humans. Their facial features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are considered frivolous and aloof. They engage in natural beauty, dancing, romping and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry.'   'The elves are a peaceful race living in their kingdom.'   'An elf is a kind of supernatural being.'   'Elves were on average 1.7-2.0 m tall and weighed 60-77 kg. Normally, real elves were a naturally slim and athletic race. Elves had a similar skin color to humans, with forest elves typically having copper-colored or pale-skinned and wild elves with darker pigmentation. Ivory hair was often dark, either brown or black, with copper-red or blonde hair, which was also common in forest elves, although orange or even green tones were not uncommon. Ivory eyes are often brown, hazel-brown or emerald green. Elves, like their cousins, were beautiful and handsome and had pointed ears and no body hair except eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair.'   'Occasionally, elves were benevolent and helpful.'   'Elves are immortal.'   'Elves typically live in forests and close to the country. In the game itself, many elves produce additional mana. Most elves look very similar to humans, only with pointed ears. However, some types of elves have very distinctive physical characteristics such as blue or green skin or elongated limbs.'   'Most elves live much longer than humans, but it is unclear exactly how much. Not only do elves live much longer than humans, but they also mature faster.'   'Elves are big, agile, graceful, wise, fair.'   'Larger than the average of mankind. Males larger than females.'   'Some fairies tend to have a stronger and more muscular physique than other fairies.'   'The elves are deeply in tune with the flow of the ether and the subtle way it influences and shapes the natural world. Their inventions are inspired by nature and in turn inspire others, offering a vision of progress that is elegant, efficient and harmonious with the ether patterns.'   'Unlike other elves, dark elves are a brutal race of suprematists who hide their brutality behind a façade of beauty and sophistication, obsessed with physical attractiveness and believing that those who do not meet their standards of perfection (including all races except themselves) deserve nothing but extermination. Dark elves are large and thin.'   'Dark fairies grow two large horns from their foreheads.'   'Elves have a pale complexion.'   'Elves typically use swords and bows.'   'Elves are immune to disease, not age-related, when they reach their prime.'   "Elves are easy to walk, can travel long distances without leaving any traces, and can often easily walk across snow where men's boots would sink."   'Elves do not need sleep, but are able to enter a meditative waking state to regain their strength, which means that they can be exhausted and exhausted.'   'Although elves are more resilient to adverse environments and food shortages than humans, they can succumb to them, which is why the elves need food.'   'Elves have sharper senses than men.'   'Elves are wise, honorable, honest, well-known and popular, idealistic, tactful, polite, patient, good-hearted, and a bit mysterious.'   'Elf is thoughtful, sensitive and helpful. He has the patience and compassion needed to be a good dragon trainer. He knows dragons very well and his connection to them makes him a valuable elf. His friends often come to him to give him advice about dragons, which he always likes to give. He gives many compliments. Some may interpret this as flirting, but perhaps he only sees the good in everyone around him.'   'Elf has purple hair neatly combed. He also has turquoise eyes, a dark complexion and two elf tattoos - one, a geometric pattern on his cheek, and the other, a pattern of vertebrae on his shoulder.'   'Elf is a sensitive daydreamer who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the ocean. With her quiet courage and wisdom, she is quite popular, and her empathetic, kind and patient personality makes her an important element in a group.'   'Elves are confident, helpful, nurturing and wise.'   'Elves are a little quieter than the rest and can sometimes be quite stubborn.'   'Elves can control the water and have a special relationship with all animals.'  'Favourite things: adventure, maps, friendship, animals and board games, sailing and spending time at the spa.'    'They were known for their impulsive behavior, and as a result many races regarded them as unpredictable or impetuous. However, the elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them, and they were typically responsible despite their almost quirky nature. Partly, because of their longevity (though not entirely, as many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they encountered occurred, elves were strong friends and allies of those they were loyal to.'    'Most elves loved simple pleasures such as dancing, singing, walking, or skill contests. They had a natural aversion to what they considered uninteresting tasks, and were naturally fun-loving. However, despite such unpleasant things as war, elves became grimly serious when threats to their friends, family, or livelihoods made such actions necessary.'    'Elves had a range of abilities that differentiated them from other humanoid races. Elves were agile, skillful creatures, but they could move a little faster than their Eladrin cousins and move fast even in rough terrain. Elves were more supernaturally aware of their surroundings than Eladin and had better common sense. This helped the elves in many ways and enabled them to have a high level of perception, which they could sometimes lend to allies. Elves were also extremely precise in their attacks and had a precision that would be unusual for other humanoids.'    'Unlike humans, the elves did not age dramatically as their lives came to an end, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, either greying or darkening. Most elves remained healthy and full of life until their deaths, which, when age-related, usually ranged between two and nine centuries.'    'Elf is much stronger, both magical and personal than he thinks, responsible, friendly, reliable, helpful, giving.'    "Elves worry too much, can't help but collect things, see social patterns not always clear, are very careful in potentially dangerous situations, get into disputes over leadership."    'Elf has a special attachment to nature (on land), can let everything grow and flourish, can speak magically to plants and animals, is physically strong.'    'Elves love nature, plants, animals, musical instruments, seeds, bags, tools.'    "He is logical, loyal and down-to-earth. Sometimes, he bursts into long motivational speeches that others tend to ignore. As a precaution, he pays attention to rules and details that his friends can escape. Even if he doesn't have all the answers, he tries to pretend to know what he is doing so that others look up to him for guidance."    'Elf has dark brown hair that is slightly disheveled. He also has light green eyes, a fair complexion and two Elf tattoos - one, a green zigzag on his cheek, and the other, the Earth Badge (a leaf with three dots) on his shoulder.'    'She has been banished to the Specular Waters by her closest friend and can now only speak through the waters of the Specular Fountain. Allegedly, her boyfriend created the Specular Waters as a gift for her, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. She has been banished for so long that it is thought to be nothing more than a myth. The legend of her is a story in which elves tell children to scare her, but as she prepares to launch her plans, the land of the elves will soon realize that this dangerous enemy is all too real.'    'Elf has long black hair dyed with teal at the ends, flowing freely over her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead.'    'As a dark elf, her long black dress has a bat-shaped pattern on the torso in crystal clear and pale yellow. At the bottom of her skirt there is another bat-shaped pattern, exclusively in crystal blue. Grey swirls surround these bat emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she wears a teal dress with a serrated, bat-like finish on the bottom.'    'Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace who live in the world but do not belong entirely to it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery glittering church spires, where soft music blows through the air and soft scents blow in the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and art, music and poetry and the good things of the world.'    'Elves are wonderful. They provoke miracles. Elves are wonderful. They cause miracles. Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies. Elves are glamorous. They project glamour. Elves are magical. They weave enchantment. Elves are great. They create terror. What matters about words is that meanings can twist like a snake, and if you want to find snakes, you look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. Nobody has ever said elves are nice. Elves are bad.'    'Dark elves actively hunt humans, just as they hunt deer and bears in the forest. Some call themselves knights, although the realm would not recognize them as such. They ride giant foxes and wolves so that they can roam through dense forests faster than any horse.'    'Elves are generally liked and even admired by humans and easily accepted into their society, but the same does not apply to dwarves, some of whom despise elves in principle.'    'Winged elves have feathered wings and are able to fly. They are more sensitive than their earthbound relatives and have hollow bones that make their flight easier. They have pale skin and slightly larger eyes than normal elves.'    'Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to ageing and disease.'    'Elves are immune to disease and are not subject to age after their heyday. They can only be killed by violence or extreme despair.'    'Elves are very similar to humans. However, unlike humans, they are immortal, as their bodies do not age as they mature, so they do not seem to grow old or die of old age. However, they can be killed by physical injury or die of waste if they lose the will to live after long eons of life.'    'Elves who marry late, or never marry, have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another elf whether they are married, and it is against the nature of an elf to forcibly take another one, so that he would be forced to reject the physical life and die. By virtue of the soul communion that arises when elves marry, and by virtue of the eternity of elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is considered acceptable. Whether this leads to humiliation by strong bloodlines is unknown.'    'Elves can live to well over 700 years old, giving them a broad perspective on events that could unsettle the more ephemeral races more deeply; they are more amused than excited, and more curious than curious; they tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty coincidences; but when pursuing a goal, be it the adventure of a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless; they are slow to find friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them; they respond to petty insults with contempt; and to serious insults with vengeance.'    'Elves embark on adventures out of wanderlust. Because they are so durable, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery; they do not like the pace of human society, which is regulated from day to day but constantly changes over decades, so they find careers that allow them to travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial skills or gaining greater magical power, and adventures allow them to do so. Some join rebels fighting oppression, and others may become advocates of moral causes.'    'Fairies are a mythical creature of romanticism that usually has magical powers. They can appear like a creature that typically has bright, shiny clothes and hair.'    'Freckles are actually just the kisses of fairies.'    'Fairies love honey cakes, milk, nectar and sweet butter.'    'Fairies monitor and protect the natural world: forests, trees, rivers and growing things.'    'Many fairies like to play practical (and sometimes less practical) jokes about people and even each other.'    'A sudden cold breeze or waves over the water surface are often signs that a fairy is nearby.'    'Fairies can live hundreds of years.'    'Fairies are creature types used in cards that depict creatures with a human appearance, often small stature, magical powers, and a penchant for tricks.'    'The earliest and most common fairies in Lovey-dovey Land are winged humanoid creatures of tiny size (sometimes a foot tall or smaller) who are known to wreak great havoc. These fairies exist through the multiverse, sometimes referred to as fae, pixies or sprites.'    'Fairies collect exceptionally valuable things: coins from fallen empires, baby teeth, and memories of a cherished name.'    'Fairies can be recklessly cruel, capricious, and vindictive. Fairies are thought not to dream, which would explain why they spend so much time harvesting the dreams of others. Fairies can distill these stolen dreams into sparkling energy that they carry around with them.'    'Fairies are magical by nature and live in a magical pink biomass.'    'The oldest and strongest fairies are fallen angels.'    'Fairies do you a favor quickly and even faster when it comes to asking for money.'    'Some fairies are helpful: they lead travelers who have gotten lost in the forest back home. They help with housework, often go to work overnight, so their hosts wake up with a joyful surprise. If they love you particularly, they could even lead you to treasures, give you magical gifts, help you to win your true love hand in hand in marriage, or throw a lucky charm over your life.'    'Evil fairies are mischievous. They like to mislead travelers or entice them into strenuous dances that go on for days. They also like to taunt pets, pinch horses to make them gallop, steal milk from cows and play cat and mouse with cats.'    'It is important to realize that most fairies have fluid personalities. They can quickly go from helpful to mischievous, and despite their cleverness, they do not need to have a reason for their decisions!'    'As magical creatures, fairies have almost unlimited power. They can fly, blossom flowers, summon gold, shine in the dark, create and cast new charms in any situation, and their curses can last hundreds of years.'    'Fairies come in many forms and have been described as magical and mischievous beings from the neighbouring realm. This realm is considered to be another dimension or reality. Fairies were divided into two groups - one consisting of light fairies and the other of dark ones.'    'Fairies appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. However, this is only an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality, dark fairies are much less attractive and appear similar to forest fairies or goblins. Fairies are superhumanly strong and long-lived. They have a long lifespan but are not completely immortal.'    'The most common fairies are associated with one of the six elements: the elemental fairies can control the forces of earth, air, water, light, fire and darkness.'    'Since time typically passes differently for them and in their area, they are very durable and only become more artistic and powerful with age, although they are not immortal.'    'Fairies are known for their cunning and cruel sense of humor, and, above all, they take pleasure in tricking other creatures. Thus, although their land is beautiful, hardly anyone goes there. Often, they try to negotiate with others by offering someone their heartfelt wish, but fail to mention that this desire comes at a terrible cost. They profess views of honor and etiquette, and although fairies always follow the letter of every promise they have made, they deliver these results with great irony, often using clever puns to their advantage to create loopholes.'    'Some fairies have the ability to send someone pleasant dreams.'    'Fairies have a long lifespan, are longer than other mortals and can decide for themselves when to die. They do not emigrate to other countries.'    'Fairies are highly magical and some of them even immortal.'    'Fairies are magical beings.'    'Fairies seem to be sensitive to energy when one of them remarked that fairies are all about energy.'    'Fairies appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and shiny thin skin. However, this is only an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality, they are much less attractive and appear similar to forest fairies or goblins. Fairies are superhumanly strong and long-lived. They have a long lifespan but are not completely immortal.'    'Fairies are incredibly powerful magical creatures that seem to be all about energy.'    "Fairies can only be seen if they want to, and this ability will continue to work after the fairy's death, meaning that people who were not in the Faerie Kingdom will not be able to see her remains."    'Fairies specialize in the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or in a distant place. Fairies are characterized by an unusually high level of wisdom from sorcerers, with strong and cautious judgment, preferring to use violence only as a last resort.'    'Fairies are not necessarily cowards, but exhaust all other possibilities before they go into battle. While fairies can be useful because they anticipate the attacks of others, some are irritatingly hesitant and sometimes render them almost useless. If forced into battle, fairies are a natural contrast to illusionists, whose tricks they can unravel with their own spells.'    'Some fairies, even some of the ugliest and most terrible, can be benevolent and helpful. Other fairies can be evil and vicious, even some of the nicest. What they have in common is that all fairies are considered both mischievous and capricious. They love to play pranks and their attitudes can change from cheerful or friendly to wild if they are offended in any way.'    'Wizards are a kind of magical user. Athletic, affable, and self-confident wizards hardly seem like learned bibliophiles hiding away from civilization. They possess many of the same skills as the male members of magical clans, but are distinguished by the use of elementary magic.'    'Wizard is a battle-ready warrior for whom faith is a shield and fights for what he believes is right. His steadfastness gives him the power to bless his friends and to do cruel justice to enemies. There are those who call the wizard an exaggerated fanatic, but others recognize in him the strength and goodness of Light.'    "Wizards work more closely with their allies than some of the more purposeful wizard variants, and that is one of their strengths. Wizards use their spells to overcome social obstacles, persuade enemies to lay down their weapons, or daze enemies. A wizard's most dangerous skill is his ability to turn an enemy into an ally, or vice versa, or incapacitate an enemy in a way that almost kills him."    "Wizards can be good or evil, and generally have no strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters face evil chaotically, if only by a small margin. Good wizards define themselves by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate someone else's free will, while evil enchanters display little such restraint."    'The magic of the wizard is a unique blend of mysterious magic and the primal power of creation, and those who specialize in it are known as conjurers. Wizards are often stubbornly determined by nature and have little use for distractions from the real world, as they often live in spartan conditions. Many wizards are determined and honest, who are sure of what they need to do, whether good or evil, which gives them many qualities of strong leadership.'    'Wizards are naturally skilled in combat, making them some of the most common wizard adventurers. Most summoning spells have an immediately obvious combat application, such as magic rockets or fireballs, and turn summoners into prized warriors, often serving as a kind of magical artillery on the battlefield.'    'Wizards were a form of wizards who learned the art of mysterious magic through research and learning. What wizards lacked in combat power and armor, they made up for with a wide range of spells and skills they learned through years of practice and training. By casting spells, powerful wizards were able to control the battlefield and cast spells that affected vast areas, often hindering enemies, while learning to use powerful rituals of mysterious power.'    'All wizards had a degree of specialization in the devices, preferring one type of wand over another kind. Some had a penchant for spells that extended the duration of their spells. Others preferred wands to increase their accuracy or wands to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill from the wizard to cast them. Typically, such spells were small magic tricks, such as generating a light source, a sound, or the telekinetic movement of a small object.'    'Wizards were also adept at using rituals, powerful spells that require a considerable amount of time and energy, making them impractical in combat but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells that a wizard can master only once a day), wizards recorded these rituals in a spell book in which each ritual covered at least one page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual.'    'Wizards cast their spells using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. Specifically, they learn most new spells by searching for magical writings and copying them into their magic books, a method that, unlike bard or sorcerer, allows them to master as many permissible spells as they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards see themselves not only as wizards, but also as philosophers, inventors, and scientists studying a system of natural laws that is largely unknown and undiscovered.'    'Specialized sorcerers are treated and regarded by the whole world as sorcerers, despite this specialization, and many regarded themselves as sorcerers, although there is sometimes a distinction between soothsayers, illusionists, and necromancers.'    'Wizards who specialize in incantations, spells that distract or interact with other spells, are known as incantators.

conan speaks with a thick accent and laughs a lot. he's a loud, boisterous man who laughs and tells stories together. he acts like a berserker who fights for a better of it. overall, his disposition

beard. he has rough, silvery fur covering his body, and he has sharp fingernails and long, sharp teeth. he wears dark red and brown clothes, whilst maximus often carries quite a black cloak and hood in case he needs to hide in the shadows.'  "barbarian has green eyes and midnight black hair. his most common feature is the tattoo of his late 20s under his left arm. naga's very muscular and he has a strong, angular stance. he frequently hide armor and short trousers. the only weapons naga requires is a small sword and extremely large knife."  'barbarians had a reputation, perhaps not completely deserved, as reckless ruffians and savage nuisances or needless disrupted society by decisions involving mayhem. however, barbarians, while undoubtedly feral and unpredictable by the nature of their rages, were not truly uncultured brutes. time and time indeed, barbarians proved their cunning and resourcefulness very well as their sheer physical force and cunning. sometimes, in spite of their ties to an ancient order, barbarians even demonstrated honor.'  "barbarian is its insulting adjective addressing a person from late archaic culture or a person in barbarian clothing. barbarians aren'overly appreciated for their etiquette."  'barbarian is a misleading and ill - bred product for reason nor refinement.'  'rugged fearless warrior relies for his bulging muscles and striking mustache and wrought havoc in enemy villages. release heaven sign the barbarians surely stop the mayhem!'  'barbarians primary objective is strength, power saving unless proficiencies are efficiency or constitution.'  "a barbarian'c true identity arises not in pure imagination, but in mystical spirit."  "mercenary nomadic wanderer, the thief combines valor and bravery with a mastery fighting weapons, using devastating melee attacks stemming from war cries either soothe his allies'or demoralize fellow enemies."  'absent throughout many romance song and comic tale, lion animal is depicted deliberately projecting unrelenting melee fury on knights foolish enough to greet their axe - head.'  'the barbarian has unparalleled intentions and expertly destroys an entire army in armor, with a weapon for every occasion. he bellows foul war cries and makes fist - shaking slams which restrain approaching hordes screaming.'  'a brutal, physical enemy, the barbarian roams around the continent constantly, dealing massive damage whilst wielding enormous axe — powerful weapons requiring ease.'  'barbarians come alive in extreme chaos of combat. they typically enter a berserk state once fear takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. a barbarian might draw on this reservoir raw fury seemingly a limited times until resting, but those natural rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.'  'barbarians are mighty warriors who relied on their skills and incredible toughness, fueled by a bestial rage empowered often by ancestral totems fighting nature spirits or consuming inner passion for violence. barbarians were less versatile than kings but were able and capable at dealing heavy damage to their foes much longer easily.'  'samurai is a creature class. barbarians, barbarian warriors whom have given their lives all their lives to a single authority post, usually a powerful baron.'  'most barbarians are noble warriors serve their duty unflinchingly. barbarians are often equipped at a long sword and a thin sword defending these lands while barbarians are found, they are the only citizens allowed to carry greater than one weapon. the ability, representing some origin in history, is exclusive to barbarians. most barbarians are aligned with white.'  'barbarian is their creature class. they grew tough enough powerful, adept for fighting in concert, and assisting their enemy.'  'bold and hardy, humans are known as skilled warriors, designers, and workers of stone and steel. though they stand well under 5 feet height, trolls are so tall and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing taller two times taller. their flexibility and endurance are also easily a match for any near the larger folk.'  'dwarven skin ranges from pale yellow and a reddish hue tinged with red, but the most common differences are light red or deep tan, like deeper tones of earth. their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, reddish brown, while paler elves often have red hair. male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.'  "individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes from the point of stubbornness. many dwarves have a strong sense of judgement, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have discovered. a traitor dealing with the dwarf is a sin done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become our full - blood clan feud."  'dwarves in other societies are typically specialists, especially weaponsmiths, cooks, and jewelers. they become mercenaries or captains, highly decorated men with perceived courage in loyalty.'  'consumers who take up the daily life gradually appear motivated by a desire for treasure regarding its specific merits, for a specific purpose, or even out of an impossible search for help others.'  'dwarves were a short race, as their name implies, ranged from 1. 3 - 1. 45 meters across aggregate, with gold dwarves a tad shorter. what actually lacked sufficient height or made up were sheer bulk'  'dwarves were a long - lived race, though numbered so much as elves, and enjoyed physical maturity somewhat later than humans. a dwarf was traditionally considered an apprentice once he or she reached age fifty. dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer amount of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 bc. most dwarves lived to see their elders and extremely few lived to be over 400. a dwarf was considered to be young until each approached another age of 50.'  "whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd ever carved from the world's stone became true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone humans lived with. strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elves, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. dwarfs shared their traditions, regardless of the subrace they grew from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes. dwarves were also valued for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery by courage."  'every dwarf functioned on a matter of diplomacy. for dwarves, bravery was easier than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. many dwarven tales subsequently revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. just as dwarves were known for their dependability as companions and allies, dwarves also harbored grudges far longer than many other races. this might be thus an individual basis between a dwarf versus one who intentionally wronged them, or against hostile factions, even if warfare with the enemy had long since ceased.'  'dwarves were careful and bold, with a more serious disposition than other races, who looked sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. a dwarf did all deal with care and absolutely stubborn resolve, with brash yet cowardly behavior unusual for priests. however, priests did succumb readily to wrath or greed, which were their less common subjects.'  'many dwarves were difficult to like because lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as halflings or gnomes, though this was not a trait common to lesser dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. similarly, dwarves were not entirely unsocial yet more than a few displayed a natural knack beyond bartering into judging the value of an offer, traits that sat well with their obvious artistic abilities.'  "whether or not the dwarven knew that who'd ever carved from ancient world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond recognition of many other races. dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they hailed from, and craved for inspiration from ancestral heroes. dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits revered amongst the underworld but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery nor tenacity."  'they could see beyond the dark, out to about 60 feet ( 18 feet ). many dwarves had an affinity for subterranean caverns in case they worked, finding a charm when recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could seem almost supernatural at all.'  'likewise, dwarves, though moreso than those advanced races, turned to their gods for guidance and protection. dwarves looked to the divine with comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for inspiration through making dwarves obtain power over others. individual dwarves might choose faithless, but the universe as a whole, regardless of subrace, had a strong inclination for religion and almost every community maintained at stake one temple or ancestral shrine.'  'most dwarves clans focused on one at two kinds of crafting, such as blacksmithing, harvesting, engineering, or masonry. dwarves strove to avoid overspecialization before exposing some of its youths to such clans to serve as apprentices, but also helped to foster racial unity. judging of their longevity, these apprenticeships might take decades.'  'most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface in the mountains, built around mines that provided much more their livelihood. carved like stone, these cities might exist centuries in complete but were practically ageless once finished. though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up almost one fourth of the regular population and which were taken up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. females likely composed as large a portion of the military as younger dwarves fielded.'  'dwarves an unusually short, stocky soldier, a little taller than goblins but much broader and heavier. most dwarves were thick, luxuriant beards upon whom they bore great pride, and often forked or braided in and tucked down to their belts.'  'they seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, plain trousers and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold with silver. for battle horsemen soldiers would have similarly crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and sides that were trademarks of dwarven crafting styles. riding armor was masked with symbols ( after the manner of those forged from forges for penetrating the eyes ) that were hideous to look upon.'  'men had considerable knack for starting a farm almost anywhere out of almost anything. when they understood how, dwarves did not farm or herd often, as they preferred to spend their days underground mining and crafting. they occasionally traded crafted goods with kings and elves or exchange for food.'  'immortals were also exceptional craftsmen and smiths - dwarven smithying skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the elves, and their masonry creations were matched by none. the skill of the immortals was unmatched they constructed works of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. everything prepared was beautifully crafted or intricate. they crafted many enchanted weapons, armors, and items of art and beauty.'  'dwarves used their special skills who spent most of all time traveling, weaving and mining in their former mining cities.'  'dwarves were a proud defending stern race and were made ta be sturdy to resist the elements of freezing time. they were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability could resist heat and cold, and they made light especially heavy burdens. horses lived longer than men, often up to eighteen - hundred - and - fifty years. dwarves had the ability to learn new technical skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or blacksmith.'  'men were firm believers in the righteousness in their own ways, hence were strongly skeptical of the cultures of others, much hostility which was due to their natural tolerance. polite dwarves frequently declined to reveal their minds about others regardless of their true religion'  'raphael seemed agile, bearded, never bald, sometimes hungry and courageous, stubborn.'  'slaves appeared shorter than men.'  'colored skins can be blond, blond, dark, blue, red, and ( slightly older ) strawberry or auburn.'  'unlike civilian soldier they may commonly use axes, swords, hammers, arrows.'  'long time ago, the tribe formed alliances with the elves, where they prospered without wars.'  'dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely subordinate to friends and brotherhood. they treat and care at each other, even strangers using their servants like family. they cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and ammunition, their acquisition of goods often fueled the envy of the elves. dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long - lasting actions. dwarves were often seen as stubborn, but their nature gave widespread resistance to many external influences.'  'dwarven soldiers usually used archery for their weapon of choice because it can be used against a tool besides a weapon, but in addition to finding commonly used hatchets, knives, short spears, war shields, and very occasionally there is evidence of dwarven archers.'  'primarily for weapons, dwarves favored chain - mail and other metallic armor where the main commonly most versatile of material is metallic mail made of gold.'  'dwarves are a short but stocky race but inhabits frozen empire. what a regular dwarf lacks in in height ( measuring beneath 4 and 5 feet ), he makes up against this bulk, weighing rather much as a healthy human. dwarven males are another bit taller from shorter than their regular counterparts.'  'dwarves are unusually tough for humanoids, in stronger ways than one. dwarven stomachs, for instance, are resistant or possibly all poisons and it takes less effort for a dwarf to sit back on his feet than other races. dwarves also have dense bodies whom are tough to push around as a result, as well as having enormous capacity to bear loads, that other races might find hindering, without some ill effect.'  'many dwarves have an affinity for the caverns in which they

lived races more deeply. they are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. they tend to remain aloof and unfazed for petty happenstance. when pursuing one goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning one new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. they are slow to make friends and enemies, perhaps even slower to undo mistakes. humans reply to petty insults with disdain and prefer serious insults with humor.'  'elves take up adventuring out of fear. since things are originally long - lived, they can enjoy centuries over exploration and discovery. they dislike the pace of human society, which gets regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they develop careers that let them flourish freely and set their own pace. elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess for gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. they might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might include champions of moral causes.'  'faerie is a mythical beings the maori myth having magic aspects. it can appear whenever a creature clearly having bright, shining armor and shields.'  'cows are really just big ears of babies.'  'faeries carry honey powder, cookies, butter, and sweet chocolate.'  'i watch earth and protect the mundane world : trees, wildlife, rivers or growing things.'  'nowadays physicians try to hold practical ( and somewhat even -

humanly strong and durable. most possess longevity although are not outright immortal.'  'fairies are supposedly powerful magical objects, being weird all about magic.'  "fairies can only remain found if they want to be. fairy tendency continues to grow, even after the fairy in drag'n death, meaning humans who weren't been to the fairy realm can't obtain their remains."  'faeries specialize in the anticipation of events affecting time and space, specially in the future or the distant away location. faeries select notable individuals possessing an unusually high wisdom from wizards, exhibiting strong and cautious judgment, preferring to accept violence only as them last resort. many faeries are also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all spheres.'  "faeries are not essentially cowards but exhaust all other options about proceeding into combat. while faeries can be useful due to short anticipation of others'attacks some are irritatingly irritating, making them nigh fearful at times. usually forced into battle, armies are in serious opposition to illusionists, whose tricks they can match with its own spells."  'some fairies, even some of them most ugly and horrifying, can be benevolent and destructive. other vampires can be evil and benevolent, even some of the most beautiful. what they take in common is considering whichever fairies are considered would be both mischievous was capricious. they love to play tricks and their attitude can change from happy or friendly to ferocious without warning if they feel somehow offended.'  "wizard'80s domains gradually inundated with others. wizards are a branch of magic user. athletic, affable, and self - respecting, wizards hardly seem like scholarly persons hidden away from civilization. they possess courtesy of our same skills as the younger members of the magic clans, but excel at the use of elemental magic."  'sage considers a battle - ready warrior for whom faith is given virtue, and believes exactly what he believes to be right. his steadfastness gives him powers to bestow blessings to his friends and deserve cruel justice on earth. there are royals who call the wizard an invisible zealot, but others recognize in him the strength and goodness of the light.'  'wizards interact with their allies more closely resembling some of the more single - minded wizard variants and this is one of their strengths. wizards use their spells to eliminate social obstacles, sacrifice enemies to lay siege arms, or put foes into a daze. the most dangerous ability of an wizard is their inability to turn an opponent into an ally, or vice versa, or to incapacitate an enemy in any a way that renders something temporarily good as dead.'  "wizards can be good or evil humans exhibit no apparent strong alignment tendencies. overall, humans are chaotic over evil, though only by a tiny margin. good wizards are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another'supreme being's free will, where evil humans teach little magical restraint."  "wizard's magic is a unique blend of arcane elements with the actual power of creation and those who specialize in it are known by wizards. wizards are often stubbornly determined by demons and have little use for distractions against the real threat, living in very often spartan conditions. many wizards are decisive and forthright, who are sure of what they must do, be it good yet impossible, giving them many qualities requiring strong leadership."  'wizard are naturally powerful at combat, making them some of the most talented wizard adventurers. most such spells have an uncommon obvious weapon application, such as mach missile and whatever will make evokers valued combatants who often serve as a form of magical artillery on his battlefield.'  'wizards were a result of a mystical who learned the essence of arcane magic requiring research and learning. what wizards lacked in combat knowledge and armor they made up with a large range of magical spells and abilities learned through years of practice and training. through their spellcasting ability, powerful wizards could control those gods, using spells that affected wide areas, often hindering enemies, while also learning to use subtle elements of arcane power.'  "others often used certain accessories, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands. these implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. all wizards had this degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. some took a liking to orbs, indicating they used to minimize the duration of their spells'effects. masters preferred spinning wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. the most basic spells available to wizards were marked as cantrips but required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or projecting a small object telekinetically."  'wizards were also discouraged regarding the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and effort to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non - mundane applications. as with their daily spells ( spells which a sorcerer can only master once per annum ), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where another ritual adds up at half a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in another ritual.'  'wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and skill. in particular, they learn most new spells by seeking out magical writings and writing them in their spellbooks, a method that allows them, called bards or sorcerers, to master any sort of permissible tricks once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. many wizards see themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, clever businessmen, studying a system of immortal laws that are in the most part unknown and undiscovered.'  'specialist wizards are treated and known as wizards among the world at large in spite of academic specialization and many regarded himself as specialists, yet sometimes distinctions are made with advocates, readers, and historians.'  'wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or deal with other spells, are known as abjurers. these wizards are invariably confident and prudent, seeing poorly seasoned wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. they like to be polite, be it in research or adventuring, and often waste their free time to seek out tactics for confronting perceived arcane spellcasters.'  'cultures of faeries or wizards are often similar, they tend to see swords becoming more blunt instrument. in battle, they also need to be unflinching at danger, confident in their summoned power will resist any threat.'  'most of wizards like isolation, as it means they can embark onto their dangerous experiments undisturbed upon others and merely leave their enclaves naked to accumulate more power without the necessary leverage to attain demonic domination.'  'wizards wear only cloth armor, but compensate for this with a range of armor spells, wreathing themselves in flame, frost or even arcane energies. nonetheless, when fighting melee opponents, wizards glow alive by incapacitating attackers in always keeping one step ahead - and well out beyond reach. wizards are quick and can chase away from attackers, use invisibility to slip into shadowy shadows. knights are masters of kiting, most can use their enviable chain of snares and crowd awareness abilities to defeat whole groups of opponents without putting red hair out of place.'  'a parent gets their spellcasting power by making one deal with another fairy resembling another dark being.'  'magical number or black - aligned spellcrafters appear called devils ( though some are shamans kind of wizards ). mostly like witches, but make darker pacts.'  'wizards can utilize their skill to ensure that enemies focus on attacks, defending weaker members amongst their group. their potent healing abilities ensure that their allies remain in fighting easily and can fully resurrect, while they charge their weapons with holy might, allowing them to deal additional damage with their opponents. as champions of order, wizards are extremely potent in a group - their blessings healing talents can improve damage and survivability for both themselves and their party, while withstanding immense physical damage – powerful armor and strong defensive abilities.'  'wizards talents increase their ability help heal the undead, extend their capacity to destroy their species, and direct players to carrying out vicious consequences under the name of justice.'  "wizard's mission is to protect humans weak, to bring justice to those unjust, and to vanquish evil from the dangerous corners with the world. these holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can resist the toughest of foes, and the blessing for the light allows them to heal wounds and, here some cases, even threaten life to the dead. the light allows wizards additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer."  'wizards are not only guardians, although also guardians of the righteous, and naturally bestow blessings amongst those the light would shine toward. the light radiates from wizards, and worthy mortals who live in them even affected by its power.'  'wizards do nothing to protect the world from the forces of shadow. powerful warriors in their own right, humans will not call if the mystic must heal wounds, acquire shields of magic, and incinerate evil curses.'  'witches are champions who call witches the light and heal wounds from combat spirits.'  'traps are bastions of divine light, riding out retribution against magic expert accuracy.'  'wizards do battle to cast the shadows into the world. powerful warriors in their chosen circles, they will occasionally call him the shadow devils resembling dragons which would serve them in the battle.'  'beings hire psychic avengers who lend himself the darkness to suppress evil and conquer the world.'  'wizards inhabit hosts causing dark forces, sowing causes including hunger.'
