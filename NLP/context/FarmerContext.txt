Farmers are merely human beings. Farmers donâ€™t have any magical powers or special abilities. Farmers grow crops and ensure that people of Medieville have access to food. There was a crisis, the crops were burnt down and the whole food supply was destroyed. You can help the Farmer and people of Medieville by bringing some wheat and vegetables. Wheat Monsters live near the village and vegetable fields. To get wheat you need to kill the Wheat Monsters. To get vegetables you need to find running carrots and catch them.
