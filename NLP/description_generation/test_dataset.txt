"Dwarves are unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, are resistant to virtually all poisons and it takes less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also have dense bodies and are difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads, that other races might find hindering, with little ill effect."
"A sudden chill breeze, or ripples across the surface of water, are often indications that a faerie is nearby."
"Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty."
"Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality, dark faeries are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal."
"Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than Men, often up to two-hundred-and-fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone."
"Elves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary."
The Barbarian is notoriously useless outside of combat because their class features are almost exclusively dedicated to act of violence.
"Faerie is a mythical being of romance usually having magic powers. It can appear as a creature typically having bright, shining clothes and hair."
"A number of black-aligned spellcrafters are called wizards (though some are shamans instead of wizards). Some are necromancers, others make demonic pacts."
"Wizards were also skilled in the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells which a wizard can only master once per day), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual."
"Barbarian characters have a strong sense of honor and duty. They are often the leaders in their groups. They are often used to being in dangerous situations, and they make good group leaders because they are used to dealing with difficult situations. They like to fight, and they are able to keep their groups moving in the right direction."
Dwarves are shorter than Men.
Faeries can live to be hundreds of years old.
"Dwarves are stocky, bearded, never bald, especially hardy and loyal, stubborn."
"Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than goblins but much broader and heavier. Most Dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts."

Treats all Gnomes and Halflings as Dwarf babies.
"Likewise, dwarves, perhaps moreso than most other races, turned to their gods for guidance and protection.Dwarves looked to the divine for comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for methods through which to obtain power over others. Individual dwarves might be faithless, but the race as a whole, regardless of subrace, had a strong inclination for religion and almost every community maintained at least one temple or ancestral shrine."
"Elves worry too much, can't help but collect things, don't always see social patterns clearly, very cautious in potential dangerous situations, gets in fights over leadership."
"Barbarian has green eyes and midnight black hair. His most distinguishing feature is the tattoo of his late mother on his left arm. He's very muscular and he has a strong, angular face. He wears hide armor and black trousers. The only weapons he requires is a small shield and a large knife."
Freckles are really just the kisses of faeries.
"Wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or interact with other spells, are known as abjurers. These wizards are usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. They like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters."
"Wizards talents increase their ability to heal the wounded, strengthen their capacity to protect their companions, and allow them to deal out vicious damage in the name of justice."
Elves have pale complexion.
"Elves are a bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times."
"Barbarians had a reputation, perhaps not completely deserved, as reckless ruffians and savage nuisances who needless disrupted society by acts of mayhem. However, barbarians, while undoubtedly feral and unpredictable by the nature of their rages, were not necessarily uncultured brutes. Time and time again, barbarians proved their cunning and resourcefulness as well as their sheer physical power and endurance. Sometimes, in spite of their aversion to an organized order, barbarians even demonstrated honor."
"Barbarians are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders."


Elves are immortal.
Dwarf refuses to wear or wield non-dwarven arms and armor.
"Barbarians have unkempt hair and rough facial features. Generally, they have a low brow, prominent nose, and thin lips. Shaggy hair and unkempt beards are common."
"Barbarian talents can improve their already considerable defenses with a shield, increase their deadliness with two-handed weapons, or bolster their savagery while dual-wielding."
"Barbarian is a tall man with slightly long brown hair. He tends to wear whatever is comfortable, usually something unusual, like a cloak made from a lion's hide. Hev is not a very handsome man, but he moves with great, athletic strength. When in battle, he usually wears next to nothing, save for a metal breast-plate taken from a slain berserker. He carries a war hammer, which he forged himself from the metal of a fallen statue. He keeps his hair greasy so opponents can't get a good grip on him."
"Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable. Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown."
An elf is a type of supernatural being.
"Dark elves actively hunt humans, just as they hunt deer and bears in the forest. Some call themselves knights, though the Realm would not recognize them as such. They ride giant foxes and wolves so they can bound through dense forests faster than any horse."
"Dwarf can't understand complicated plans, or they refuse to try. It should be plain and simple, otherwise he drools or something of the like."
Taller than average height of Mankind. Males taller than females.
"Faeries appear to be sensitive to energy, as one of them made the comment that fairies are all about energy."
"Elves stood on average 1.7-2.0m and weighed 60-77kg. Usually, true elves were a naturally slender and athletic race. Elves had a similar range of complexions to humans, with wood elves typically coppery or pale skinned and wild elves having darker pigmentation. Often, elven hair was dark, either brown or black, with copper red or blond hair also found amongst wood elves, although orange or even green hues were not completely unheard of. Elven eyes are commonly brown, hazel, or an emerald green. Elves, like their cousins, were fair and beautiful, handsome, and had pointed ears and no body hair except eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair."
"Many dwarves have an affinity for the caverns in which they live, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could almost seem supernatural at times. They are also renowned for their metalworking and crafting abilities."
Many faeries like to play practical (and sometimes not-so-practical) jokes on humans and even each other.
"She was banished to the Specular Waters by her closest friend, and can now only speak through the waters of Specular Fountain. Supposedly, her friend created the Specular Waters as a gift for her, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. She has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. The Legend of she is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as she prepares to put her schemes into motion, the land of elves will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real."
"Wizard's purpose is to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. The light grants wizards additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer."
"These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea."
"Wizards work with their allies more closely than some of the more single-minded wizard variants and this is one of their strengths. Wizards use their spells to overcome social obstacles, convince enemies to lay down arms, or put foes into a daze. The most dangerous ability of an wizard is their ability to turn an enemy into an ally, or vice versa, or to incapacitate an enemy in such a way that renders them as good as dead."
"Faeries are known for their cunning and their cruel sense of humor, and they especially delight in tricking other creatures. Therefore, even though their land is beautiful, hardly anyone goes there. They frequently seek to bargain with others, offering someone their heart's desire but failing to mention that the desire comes with a terrible cost. They are committed to notions of honor and etiquette, and while faeries always exactly follow the letter of any promise they have made, they deliver these results with great irony and often use clever wordplay to their advantage in order to create loopholes."
"It's important to be aware that most faeries have fluid personalities. They can go from helpful to mischievous quickly, and despite their cleverness, they don't have to have a reason for their decisions!"
"A barbarian's true strength lies not in the body, but in the spirit."
"Barbarians can be excellent warriors. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly throw himself into a berserk rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent. Barbarians can't use plate mail armor, unlike the other three warrior classes. They use the fighter avatar for their appearance. The Barbarian can draw from a high level ability pool which gives the barbarian some extra abilities."
