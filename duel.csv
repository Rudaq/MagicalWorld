Don't be hitting me in my head when I'm not looking. You just awakened a sleeping giant.
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. His hands can't hit what his eyes can't see.
Why kill you now, with no one here to see you fall?
What was the outcome of the duel will be terrible.
Who's the better killer? Let's play this game.
Ah, a duel then.
When a man with a .45 meets a man with a rifle, the man with a pistol will be a dead man.
You got one shot left in that shooter. Make the most of it.
I find it rude to laugh at a man with a sword.
It's time to duel!
When two evil guys fight in a duel,
the worst of both will be the winner.
A long marriage is two people trying to dance a duet and two solos at the same time.
Wouldn’t you rather play chess, Ma’am?....It’s less destructive of clothes.
Is that all you've got? A few tricks and quick feet? That's no way to enforce your bold tongue!
The duel may go on for a long time, but self-defense often wins over self-reproach.
Did I ever tell you I was challenged to a duel once, when I was a student in Geneva?
Fantastic! I'd love to fight a duel!
Solid objects will not keep anyone safe in this conflict.
Do you know how to win a sword fight? Be the only one with a sword!
Do not turn your back on me, for I will fight you!
You are one dumb son of a bitch. Bringing a knife to a gunfight.
A duel, whether regarded as a ceremony in the cult of honour, or even when reduced in its moral essence to a form of manly sport, demands a perfect singleness of intention, a homicidal austerity of mood. 
I challenge you to a duel!
I wish to duel you in the name of honor
Time to duel!
Insult, it's time for a battle!
Get out of here, monster, I challenge you to a duel!
You pissed me off, we have to fight a duel!
I'll kick your butt!
You won't run away from me, it's time for a battle!
You have no need to run away for the battle!
You are against me, it must end with a duel!
If you are not afraid, loser, it's time to duel!
In words, everyone is strong, come to a duel!
This insult, it takes blood!
In a moment nothing of you will be left, come fight!
I challenge you for a fight!
Lets fight!
What good has ended, it's time to fight!
I can smell how scared are you, time to start a fight!
