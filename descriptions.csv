BARBARIAN;
Barbarians come in a lot of different shapes and sizes, but most tend to be taller and more muscular than other classes. They have faces that let them look intense and animalistic. They have powerful builds, so they're able to use heavy weapons and carry lots of equipment.;
Their arms tend to be long, and they have rough skin. Coming up with a good physical description for your barbarian character is important because it can help you to think about how your character's appearance will affect their behavior and outlook on life.;
Barbarians wear clothes that are rough and rugged. While many stereotypes depict barbarians as wearing nothing but a loincloth, but this is rarely true. Barbarians come from the wilds outside society, but this doesn't mean that they don't have their own sense of class and style. Some barbarian cultures favor colorful clothing and ornate jewelry.;
Barbarians are in a constant state of physical conflict, so it's common for them to have obvious signs of past wounds. Barbarians also sometimes use scars and battle marks as tattoos, so if you have the option, you might want to avoid using the deformity rules.;
Barbarians have unkempt hair and rough facial features. Generally, they have a low brow, prominent nose, and thin lips. Shaggy hair and unkempt beards are common.;
Barbarians have tough, thick skin and are sometimes covered in scars. They often have a healthy tan.;
Barbarians have long, messy hair. They sometimes have beards. They are also some few characters who are allowed to wear their hair long.;
There is no cultural norm for hair color, but most barbarians have dark hair or hair that is dark at the roots and light at the ends.;
While there's no cultural norm for eye color, most barbarians have dark eyes.;
Barbarians have a strong sense of community and honor. They are proud and believe in living as close to nature as possible. Barbarians are also traditionalists. They respect the traditions of the past, especially those that are related to warfare and combat.;
They have a sense of duty and honor, and they follow a strict code. They consider their actions to be the result of the decisions that they make, and they would never seek to blame others for their decisions.;
Barbarians are generally at peace with most species and cultures. They tend to get along with those who have warrior traditions. They are also closely tied to the natural world, so they are usually in harmony with nature.;
It is unusual for a barbarian to worship a god. Barbarians generally find it more natural to worship a pantheon of gods or nature. Many barbarians believe that they are a living incarnation of a god. Although barbarians have no formal religion, they have a strong sense of honor and loyalty. They try to emulate their gods by living in harmony with nature and fulfilling their duties.;
Barbarians are usually adventurers just because they don't really know what else to do. They have an inherent wanderlust and a desire to stand out. They have a strong sense of honor, so they often look for opportunities to prove themselves. They are natural leaders, so they often rise to leadership positions in groups.;
Your barbarian character has a strong sense of honor and tradition. They have close relationships with their tribe members, family members, and friends. They are used to fighting, and they see battle as a natural part of life. They aren't afraid to fight, and they aren't afraid to die. They don't see life as something that should be wasted.;
Your barbarian character has a sense of community and responsibility. They are loyal to their friends and family, and they have an obligation to protect the weak and innocent. They are used to adapting to dangerous situations and taking care of themselves. They have seen terrible things, but they choose to keep fighting so that they can protect others.;
Your barbarian character is a traditionalist. They have a strong sense of duty and honor, and they follow a strict code. They consider their actions to be the result of the decisions that they make, and they would never seek to blame others for their decisions.;
Your barbarian character has a strong sense of honor and duty. They are often the leaders in their groups. They are often used to being in dangerous situations, and they make good group leaders because they are used to dealing with difficult situations. They like to fight, and they are able to keep their groups moving in the right direction.;
These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea.;
For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength.;
Not every member of the tribes deemed barbarians by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don't have to.;
Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.;
Barbarians are all about getting angry and dealing damage. They have a ton of hit points, resistance to damage, and Rage gives a wonderful bonus to damage. Barbarians don't get much in the way of skills, so generally they're stuck as combat monsters, but they function equally well as a defender and a striker, and certain character options can even expand them into a limited support role.;
The Barbarian is notoriously useless outside of combat because their class features are almost exclusively dedicated to act of violence. ;
Barbarians are melee fighters highly trained in the arts of weaponry. These mighty warriors, strong and quick on the battlefield, depend on their heavy plate armor, shields, and battle prowess to defend themselves and ensure enemies don't focus on their softer-skinned allies. Weapon mastery is a staple of warrior training, and they are capable of delivering high damage with enormous two-handed weapons or by wielding two weapons. As barbarians deal or take damage, their rage grows, allowing them to deliver truly crushing attacks in the heat of battle.;
Barbarians are usually leading the charge into battle, tearing across the battlefield and using furious shouts and terrifying banners to rally their allies and intimidate their enemies. Whether striking down opponents with mighty two-handed weapons, tearing into packs of enemies in a whirlwind of steel, or standing firm in the face of death itself, warriors excel at battle with a range of powerful attacks and battlefield maneuvers, as masters of both skillful strikes and devastating blows.;
Barbarians equip themselves carefully for combat and engage their enemies head-on, letting attacks glance off their heavy armor. They use diverse combat tactics and a wide variety of weapon types to protect their more vulnerable allies. Barbarians must carefully master their rage - the power behind their strongest attacks - in order to maximize their effectiveness in combat.;
Barbarian talents can improve their already considerable defenses with a shield, increase their deadliness with two-handed weapons, or bolster their savagery while dual-wielding.;
Barbarians are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders.;
Every dragon slain, corrupted tyrant toppled, and demon banished from Dreary Forest has trembled in the face of these lords of war.;
Barbarians train constantly and strive for perfection in armed combat. Though they come from all walks of life, they are united in their singular commitment to engage in glorious battle. Many warriors serve as mercenary soldiers, while others become adventurers and danger-seeking fortune hunters. A typical warrior is strong, tough, and exceptionally violent.;
Combining a mastery of weapons and prowess in battle, Barbarians storm fearlessly into the front lines of any fight.;
Strength saves are fairly rare, but constitution saves are common and typically very problematic.;
Medium armor and martial weapons will get you a long way, but you get no tool proficiencies, and only two skills.;
Rage is the Barbarian's defining class feature. The bonus damage isn't huge, but it's reliable and consistent. The resistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage multiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but your number of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid it.;
She is a fighter, through and through. She's tough and headstrong, never giving up until her opponent is down. She's a little dense sometimes, however, and it takes her a while to realize when she's outmatched by her opponent. She is very loyal to her friends, and she uses her muscles and brawn to protect them. She also loves to tell a joke or a story, making her a fun person to be around.;
She is tall and brawny. She has bright red hair, cropped short. Her bright green eyes are constantly assessing her surroundings while she's out on the road. Her vest is very practical, with a number of small pouches attached all around. She wears a small bag on her side, with a short sword strapped to her back.;
The Barbarian is a champion, swordsman, swordswoman, soldier, and brawler who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics. Barbarians can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good Barbarian needs to be strong and healthy if they hope to survive.;
Barbarians can be excellent warriors. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly throw himself into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent. Barbarians can't use plate mail armor, unlike the other three warrior classes. They use the fighter avatar for their appearance. The Barbarian can draw from a high level ability pool which gives the barbarian some extra abilities.;
He is a very friendly, outgoing person who just loves to share a good drink with anyone willing to listen. He's never afraid to speak his mind, even if it gets him in trouble. He's happy with his life as an adventurer and looks forward to seeing the world. He loves a good fight as much as the next barbarian, but he doesn't like to kill. Well, not all the time. If his life or a friend's life is in danger, he will totally destroy his enemies. He has a soft spot for other barbarians, however, even if they are from a different tribe.;
He also has a fear of large creatures, like trolls and giants, and he has a crippling fear of bees. This came about because of his childhood, where a giant and a bee attacked him when he was a young boy. He knows this fear isn't rational, but he can't help it. If he sees a bee, he will go into a barbarian rage, attacking the bee and anyone who gets in his way. He will stop when the bee is dead or he is dead. Other than the bees and giants, he is a fearless fighter who will attack anyone that gets in his way.;
I don't like to see the world in black and white. I like to see it in color. I love to talk to new people and learn about their culture, their life and their history. I just wish it didn't always come down to fighting.;
He is a tall man with slightly long brown hair. He tends to wear whatever is comfortable, usually something unusual, like a cloak made from a lion's hide. He's not a very handsome man, but he moves with great, athletic strength. When in battle, he usually wears next to nothing, save for a metal breast-plate taken from a slain berserker. He carries a war hammer, which he forged himself from the metal of a fallen statue. He keeps his hair greasy so opponents can't get a good grip on him.;
He has a scar running along the left side of his face, from his forehead down to his chin. He got this from a duel with a baby dragon that got out of hand, as his previous battle scars testify. His left ear is also slightly deformed, but he wears an earring in it. He speaks with a thick accent and swears a lot. He's a loud, boisterous man who laughs and tells stories constantly. He acts like a berserker who fights for the fun of it. Overall, his appearance tends to scare people away, and he's fine with that.;
He likes his life of adventure, traveling the countryside, earning gold, and drinking. He has no interest in settling down, but he's always open to hearing about it. He is traveling the Kingdom, trying to make his fortune fighting the orcs and other monsters. He's been looking for a unique magic item that many say don't exist a lute of persuasion. He's heard rumors of such an item but has never seen it. ;
He has long dark hair and sharp yellow eyes. He has rough, black fur covering his body, and he has sharp fingernails and long, sharp teeth. He wears dark blue and black clothes, but he often carries around a black cloak and hood in case he needs to hide in the shadows.;
He is a slight, dark-haired halfling. He has a small, oval-shaped head, and a long, thin chin. He has a thin, scraggly mustache and a beard of the same color. His eyes are deep-set and sad. He wears a small golden necklace of his grandmother's, and a small brown belt with a shiny buckle. He wears simple clothes, and a nice, brown vest. He wears a small, multi-colored backpack with a picture of a tree on it.;
He was born into a long line of miners. His father was dark and one day disappeared during a dark storm. He was out in the mines, and never returned. His mother was heartbroken, and left with him. They moved to the kingdom, and lived there for many years. He grew up on a farm on the outskirts of kingdom. He received lessons on how to farm, and learned from the many farmers around him. Soon, he was old enough to fight and he decided to start the adventure.;
He is a calm and collected fellow. He is a very quiet man who enjoys spending time alone. He is wise and very mature, but he can sometimes be a bit short-tempered. He's a kind man and will help anyone out who needs it.;
He isn't very trusting of people he doesn't know, taking a while to warm up to them. He also has very little patience for jokers. Once he knows someone, he's extremely loyal and a good friend. He's often prone to being headstrong, but he's quick to admit when he's wrong.;
He has green eyes and midnight black hair. His most distinguishing feature is the tattoo of his late mother on his left arm. He's very muscular and he has a strong, angular face. He wears hide armor and black trousers. The only weapons he requires is a small shield and a large knife.;
Barbarians had a reputation, perhaps not completely deserved, as reckless ruffians and savage nuisances who needless disrupted society by acts of mayhem. However, barbarians, while undoubtedly feral and unpredictable by the nature of their rages, were not necessarily uncultured brutes. Time and time again, barbarians proved their cunning and resourcefulness as well as their sheer physical power and endurance. Sometimes, in spite of their aversion to an organized order, barbarians even demonstrated honor.;
She is happy and outgoing. She loves life and is willing to jump into any adventure. She is always looking for a challenge. She is also fearless and stubborn. She does not let anyone get in the way of what she wants. When she meets a dragon, she is ready and willing to fight. She always wants to be doing something exciting, and she is never afraid to try anything. She is curious about everything around her.;
Barbarian is an insulting word for a person from an uncivilized culture or a person with no manners. Barbarians aren't known for their etiquette.;
Barbarian is a crude uncouth ill-bred person lacking culture or refinement.;
This fearless warrior relies on his bulging muscles and striking mustache to wreak havoc in enemy villages. Release a horde of Barbarians and enjoy the mayhem!;
He appears as a male kilt-clad warrior with an angry, battle-ready expression, hungry for destruction. He has close-cropped blond hair and a long, yellow horseshoe mustache. In battle, he wields a sword which he uses to attack.;
Barbarians primary ability is strength, their saving throw proficiencies are strength and constitution.;
A barbarian's true strength lies not in the body, but in the spirit.;
A nomadic wanderer, the Barbarian combines brawn and ruggedness with a mastery of weapons, using devastating melee attacks along with war cries to boost his allies' or demoralize his enemies.;
Glorified by many a song and fireside tale, the Barbarian is unrivaled in delivering unrelenting melee fury on anyone foolish enough to greet their axe-head.;
The Barbarian has unparalleled strength and expertly wields an entire arsenal in battle, with a weapon for every occasion. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shaking slams to send approaching hordes reeling.;
A brutal, physical warrior, the Barbarian roams around the battlefield constantly, dishing heavy damage and wielding an array of powerful weapons with ease.;
Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise.;
Barbarians are mighty warriors who relied on their strength and incredible toughness, characterized by a bestial rage empowered either by ancestral totems and nature spirits or an inner passion for violence. Barbarians were less versatile than fighters but were tougher and capable of dealing heavy damage to their foes much more quickly.;
Barbarian is a creature class. Barbarians, are warriors who have sworn their service and their lives to a single authority figure, usually a feudal lord.;
Most barbarians are noble and serve their duty unflinchingly. Barbarians are often equipped with a longsword and a shortsword in many lands whert barbarians are found, they are the only citizens allowed to carry more than one weapon. The ability, representing their power in combat, is exclusive to barbarians. Most barbarians are aligned with white.;
Some barbarians, due to personal dishonor or the death of their lord, become rogues called ronin. Ronin may be just as honorable as othet barbarians or as underhanded as the darkest rogue. Ronin are usually black or red.;
Barbarian is a creature class. They are tough and disciplined, adept at fighting in concert, and overwhelming the enemy.;
DWARF;
Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk.;
Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.;
Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.;
Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty.;
Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.;
Physically durable, insightful, primarily dwell underground, some females capable of growing beards.;
Dwarves were a natural humanoid race common throughout parts of Frozen Empire as well as Desolation of abomination. Dwarves were a tough, tradition-abiding folk known for their strong martial traditions and beautiful craftsmanship.;
Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 1.3 - 1.45 meters on average, with gold dwarves a bit shorter. What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk; they were, on average, about as heavy as humans. A dwarf could weigh anywhere from about 73-100kg. Dwarven males were a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts. Like humans, dwarves had a wide variety of skin, eye, and hair colors, typically pale among shield dwarves and deeply tanned or brown amongst gold dwarves. Hazel eyes were common throughout the race, with blue eyes more common amongst shield dwarves and brown or green eyes found amongst the gold dwarves.
Dwarves were a long-lived race, though not so much as elves, and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she reached age fifty. Dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer period of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 years. Most dwarves lived to see their bicentennial and a few lived to be over 400. A dwarf was considered to be young until they reached the age of 50.;
Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes. Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity.;
Dwarven friendship was hard to earn, but was strong once won. Naturally dour and suspicious, the stout folk were slow to trust others, specifically those outside their family, suspecting the worst of an individual until the outsider had proved their good will many times. Once this trust was gained, dwarves held their friends to it and viewed betrayals, even minor ones, with a vicious propensity for vengeance. A common gnomish oath, remarking on this dwarven sense of justice, was If I'm lying, may I cross a dwarf.;
A dwarf advises on a matter of diplomacy. For dwarves, loyalty was more than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. Dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. Many dwarven tales subsequently revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. Just as dwarves were known for their dependability as friends and allies, dwarves also harbored grudges far longer than many other races. This might be on an individual basis between a dwarf and one who had wronged them, or against entire races, even if warfare with the enemy had long since ceased.;
Dwarves were careful and deliberate, with a more serious disposition than other races, who they sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. A dwarf did all things with care and a stubborn resolve, with brash or cowardly behavior unusual for them. However, dwarves did succumb easily to wrath or greed, which were their most common vices.;
Dwarves who left their homeland to become adventurers did so for a number of reasons. In part, a dwarf might be motivated by simple avarice, given the dwarven love of beautiful things. As often, however, a dwarf might be motivated by a drive to do what was right for others (particularly their clan) or a love of excitement because, as settled as dwarves were, they rarely tired of thrills. But even these wayward dwarves retained the spirit of their brethren, hoping that their accomplishments abroad could bring honor to themselves, their clan, or both. Given that successful dwarven adventurers were likely to recover rare items or defeat enemies of the dwarven people during such challenges, this was a hope not entirely without merit.;
Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as halflings or gnomes, though this was not a trait common to all dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely unsocial and more than a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, something that sat well with their legendary crafting abilities.;

Dwarves could see in the dark, out to about 60 feet (18 meters). Many dwarves had an affinity for the caverns in which they lived, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could seem almost supernatural at times.;
A dwarf having a snooze after eating. Dwarves highly valued the ties between family members and friends, weaving tightly knit clans. Dwarves particularly respected elders, from whom they expected sound leadership and the wisdom of experience, as well as ancestral heroes or clan founders. This idea carried on to relations with other races and dwarves were deferential even to the elders of another, non-dwarven race.;
Likewise, dwarves, perhaps moreso than most other races, turned to their gods for guidance and protection. Non-evil dwarves looked to the divine for comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for methods through which to obtain power over others. Individual dwarves might be faithless, but the race as a whole, regardless of subrace, had a strong inclination for religion and almost every community maintained at least one temple or ancestral shrine.;
Most dwarven societies were divided into clans built along family ties and political allegiances. These clans were usually led by hereditary rulers, often monarchs of a sort and descended from the founder of the clan. Dwarves strongly valued loyalty to these rulers and to the clan as a whole and even objective dwarves tended to side primarily with their kin over other races or communities.;
Most dwarven clans focused on one or two kinds of crafting, such as blacksmithing, jewelry, engineering, or masonry. Dwarves strove to avoid overspecialization by sending some of their youths to other clans to serve as apprentices, which also helped to foster racial unity. Because of their longevity, these apprenticeships might last decades.;
Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface in the mountains, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did.;
Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than goblins but much broader and heavier. Most Dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts.;
They seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle their soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and styles that were trademarks of Dwarven crafting styles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon.;
They had a knack for starting a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything. Although they knew how, Dwarves did not farm or herd often, as they preferred to spend their time underground mining and crafting. They rather traded crafted items with Men and Elves in exchange for food.;
They were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithying skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the Elves, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The skill of the Dwarves was unmatched they crafted objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Everything Dwarven was beautifully crafted and intricate. They crafted many famed weapons, armors, and items of art and beauty.;
Dwarves were taught special skills and spent most of their time crafting, smithying and mining in their massive underground cities.;
Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than Men, often up to two-hundred-and-fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone.;
Dwarven women were alike in manner, voice and appearance to their menfolk. They were few in number, less than a third of all dwarf-kind, and they were seldom seen outside their own halls, often not venturing far due to their duties as caretakers and crafters in Dwarven society. They typically only travelled when in great need, and they usually dressed similarly to Dwarf men. This often led other folk to believe there were no women among the Dwarves, that Dwarves grew from stone when created. Few female Dwarven warriors were known, but some tales say that female Dwarves were as fierce as their male counterparts, especially in protecting their families and offspring. Dwarves were usually monogamous, and fewer than one-third of Dwarven men took a wife, the rest busying themselves with their crafts.;
For dwarves, loyalty was more than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. Dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm.

Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did;
In their own homelands, dwarves continuously carved out new living space, mining the mountains' riches as they did so. Dwarves in general stuck to these locales, disliking travel, particularly along waterways, but those who lived in human lands could make themselves quite comfortable. Most who did made a living as mercenaries, smiths, or artisans of various kinds. Dwarves were eagerly sought after as warriors, their reputation for courage and loyalty making them excellent choices for bodyguards;
Dwarves were firm believers in the righteousness of their own ways, yet were surprisingly tolerant of the cultures of others, much of which was due to their natural introversion. Polite dwarves normally declined to speak their minds about others regardless of their true feelings; behavior considered good enough was left alone and not considered their business. Certain violent behavior might prompt more direct forms of response, but for the most part dwarves would live and let live. They got along passably well with most other races, their pragmatism and sense of honor serving diplomacy well, and few reasonable societies could not come to some level of agreement of them.
They live around 250-350 years.;
Dwarves are stocky, bearded, never bald, especially hardy and loyal, stubborn.;
Dwarves are shorter than Men.;
Their hair can be blond, brown, black, blue, red, and (when older) grey or white.;
As a weapon they very often use axes, swords, hammers, mattocks.;
Long time ago, the dwarves made alliances with the elves, and both prospered from trade.;
Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than hobbits but much broader and heavier. Most dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts.;
They seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle their soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and styles that were trademarks of dwarven crafting styles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon.;
Dwarven women were alike in manner, voice and appearance to their menfolk. They were few in number, less than a third of all dwarf-kind, and they were seldom seen outside their own halls, often not venturing far due to their duties as caretakers and crafters in dwarven society. They typically only travelled when in great need, and they usually dressed similarly to dwarf men. This often led other folk to believe there were no women among the dwarves, that dwarves grew from stone when created. Few female dwarven warriors were known, but some tales say that female dwarves were as fierce as their male counterparts, especially in protecting their families and offspring. Dwarves were usually monogamous, and fewer than one-third of dwarven men took a wife, the rest busying themselves with their crafts.;
Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than men, often up to two-hundred-and-fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone.;
Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to friends and family. They treat and care for each other, even strangers among their kind like family. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and gems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the elves. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often seen as greedy, but their nature gave them resistance to many external influences. ;
They were also capable masons and smiths. Dwarven smithying skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the elves, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The skill of the dwarves was unmatched; they crafted objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Everything dwarven was beautifully crafted and intricate.
Dwarven soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because it can be used as a tool or a weapon, but in addition to axes they used hatchets, mattocks, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionally there is mention of dwarven archers.;
As for armor, Dwarves favored chain-mail and other metallic armor where the most expensive and precious of which was ring mail made of gold.;
Dwarves are a short but stocky race that inhabits Frozen Empire. What a regular dwarf lacks in in height (measuring between 4 and 5 feet), he makes up for in bulk, weighing as much as a mature human. Dwarven males are a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts.;
Dwarves are unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, are resistant to virtually all poisons and it takes less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also have dense bodies and are difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads, that other races might find hindering, with little ill effect.;
Many dwarves have an affinity for the caverns in which they live, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could almost seem supernatural at times. They are also renowned for their metalworking and crafting abilities.;
All dwarfs have beards and wear up to twelve layers of clothing. Gender is more or less optional.;
Dwarves are short and stocky, easily identifiable by their size and shape. They have ruddy cheeks, dark eyes, and dark hair. Dwarves tend to be dour and taciturn. They are given to hard work, and care little for most humor. They enjoy beer, ale, mead, but most of all, they love gold. There are four racial divisions of dwarves within the realms: shield dwarves, gold dwarves, wild dwarves, and duergar.;
He is obsessed with finding rubies. He will take a hand full of rubies over a chest full of gold any day.;
He secretly hates beer as it's too bitter. Dwarf drinks rum instead.;

Dwarf builds tiny servants of limited-sentience. Calls them his babies.;
Incredibly and uncomfortably affectionate when drunk.;
Refuses to wear or wield non-dwarven arms and armor.;

Dwarves are a short but stocky race that inhabits Frozen Empire. What a regular dwarf lacks in in height, he makes up for in bulk, weighing as much as a mature human. Dwarven males are a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts.;
Male dwarves are often bald and grow thick facial hair, which is sometimes used to display social status. Unusually for humanoids, both sexes naturally grow ample facial hair, though the majority of shield dwarf females shave their beards off.;
Dwarves are usually portrayed as skilled engineers, and almost always have a special password, usually Lali-ho! or something similar. Depending on the game, they may have a friendly or hostile relationship with the Elves, or none at all.;
Claims to be a heir of a former king but he is not.;

Hates the sound of metal clanking as he grew up next to a blacksmith, who would at odd hours, which would keep him up at night. He sleeps with ear plugs when in the city.;
Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.;
Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.;
ELF;
Elves are generally considered one of the most beautiful races. They are slightly shorter and more delicate than humans and are not as hardy. Elves are a rare sight on the sword coast perhaps because they prefer the wild to human cities. While they are well known as a cheerful and frolicsome race, many elves, especially drow, are as surly as dwarves or as prideful as humans.;
They are said to have the most beautiful voices of all kinds. This makes them highly sought after by bards.;
Elves tend to be taller and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof. They concern themselves with natural beauty, dancing, frolicking, and other similar pursuits. Their humor is clever, as are their songs and poetry. ;
Humanoid, long pointed ears, taller than humans.;
The Elves are a peaceful race that reside in their kingdom. Their leader is the Prince of Elves.;
An elf is a type of supernatural being.;
Elves stood on average 1.7-2.0m and weighed 60-77kg. Usually, true elves were a naturally slender and athletic race. Elves had a similar range of complexions to humans, with wood elves typically coppery or pale skinned and wild elves having darker pigmentation. Often, elven hair was dark, either brown or black, with copper red or blond hair also found amongst wood elves, although orange or even green hues were not completely unheard of. Elven eyes are commonly brown, hazel, or an emerald green. Elves, like their cousins, were fair and beautiful, handsome, and had pointed ears and no body hair except eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair.;
Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to.;
Elves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary.;
Elves occasionally also were benevolent and helpful.;
Other namesof the Elves: people of the Stars, Firstborn, Elder Children.;
Elves are immortal.;
Elves typically live in forests, and are close to the land. In the game itself, many elves produce additional mana. Most elves look much like humans, only with pointed ears. Some types of elves have very distinctive physical features, however, such as blue or green skin or elongated limbs.;
Most elves live far longer than humans, but it's unclear exactly how much. Elves not only live far longer than humans but also mature faster it is unknown if this is common to all elves or just those of the Enchated Forest.;
They are tall, agile, graceful, wise, fair.;
Taller than average height of Mankind. Males taller than females.;
Some elves tend to have a more powerful and muscular build than other elves.;
Enchanted Forest's elves carry weapons and wear armor made from an ancient, bronze-like metal. Each weapon is custom smithed for a single elf and is carried through that elf's lifetime, then melted down and re-shaped for the next generation.;
The elves of Enchanted Forest are deeply in tune with the flow of aether and the subtle ways it influences and shapes the natural world. Their inventions are inspired by nature and in turn they inspire others, offering a vision of progress that is elegant, efficient, and harmonious with the aether patterns. While most of them are not aligned with the consulate, several live in distant places and support its infrastructure, seeking to preserve the status quo and allow the aether cycle to turn. Only in rare cases do they take part in politics or resistance movements. In exchange, the consulate grants them large judicial autonomy. Elves are tried under the Sunny Path, an ancient code of conduct that has a variety of laws and punishments that seem minor to outsiders, but are viewed as harsh by the elves themselves.;
The Elves of Enchated Forest rely on exquisite fighting techniques in combat and are known for crafting elegant and durable weapons. Although elves are less charismatic than other champions, the crowd of different lands loves watching them for their sheer fighting artistry. The stadium was founded through the patronage of elven founders.;
Unlike other elves, Dark Elves are a brutal race of supremacists who hide their savagery behind a facade of beauty and sophistication. They are obsessed with physical attractiveness and believe that those who do not meet their standards of perfection (including all races other than themselves) deserve nothing but extermination. The elves divide themselves into numerous tribes and castes, the most powerful of which is the Great Tribe. Dark Elves are tall and thin. They have ram-like horns (males' horns being longer than females'). ;
Dark Elves have a pair of big horns growing from their foreheads. They are primarily associated with the worshipping of the Moon Gods.;
The elves of Enchanted Forest are a highly adaptive race that makes their homes in the treetops. Natural risk-takers, the elves have a strong survival instinct and fearless demeanor, making them well suited for life on this dangerous plane. They lack a formal religion, instead, they practice forms of mysticism as well as communing with the spirits of their ancestors and talking with gods.;
Elves have pale complexion.;
They may have differen hair colors, like: black, silver,  gold, blonde, golden, silver.;
Weapons are typically swords and bows.;
Elves were immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.;
Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink;
They do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire.;
Although the Elves are more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them thus Elves do require sustenance.;
Elves had keener senses than Men. They were slender,  graceful yet strong, and were resistant to extremes of nature, illness and disease. ;
They detested all evil and were usually more resistant to being corrupted than Men, unless evil tricked them with fair form.;
Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force; one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable.Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown.
Strengths: Wise, honorable, honest, well known and liked, idealistic, tactful, polite, patient, good listener, and a bit mysterious.;
Thinks a lot! Often looks to books for answers instead of within. He needs his space once in a while, which sometimes comes across quite rude.;
Strong ability to control nature. Great with animals but especially Treants (rare).;
Favorite things: Antiques of any kind, books, feathered pens and quality paper, dragons, and anything connected to dragons.;
He is thoughtful, sensitive, and helpful. He has the patience and compassion needed to be a good dragon trainer. He is very knowledgeable about dragons, and his connection with them makes him a valuable elf to have around. His friends often come to him for treant-related advice, which he is always happy to give. He gives many compliments. Some might interpret this as flirting, but maybe he just sees the good in everyone around him.;
He has purple hair that is kept neatly combed. He also has turquoise eyes, a dark complexion, and two Elf Tattoos - one, a geometric design on his cheek, and the other, a pattern of swirls on his shoulder.;
He sports a dark green tank-top with brown, geometric shapes on it. The sash that he wears across his shirt is light-brown, and mostly consists of thin straps. The part that covers his right shoulder is thicker, with a feathered pattern, and has a purple emblem on it. He also wears black pants.;
He has the attitude and insightfulness of a mage destined. Like his brother, he bears the Curse, and this curse has made him frail and sickly from the moment of his birth. Were it not for the many medical remedies and magical potions bought at great expense to keep his strength up, he would've died many years ago. It was only the love and care of his brother  and the elderly which saw him pull through this rough childhood. ;
This sword was forged by him, a powerful weapon to protect himself as he began the perilous quest to rescue his brother. It is charged with crackling energy that rends apart those struck by its shining blade.;
In times of great need, he can call upon the full power of his sword. Doing so allows him to unleash a fearsome barrage of magical power, or else dissipate dangerous sorcerers energies before they spiral out of control, but also leaves himself badly weakened.;
Though seemingly fragile, this well-worn heirloom has seen a thousand battles and will see many more.;
Since his sickly childhood, he has carried supplies of these revitalizing tonics wherever he goes. ;
She is the water elf with an adventurer at heart. She is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group.;
Controls bodies of water: the sea, lakes and waterfalls.;
Confident, helpful, nurturing and wise.;
A bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times.;
She controls water and has a special relationship with all water animals; she is quite powerful for her age. She can make others feel special.
Favorite things: Adventures, maps, friendship, animals and board games, sailing and spending time in the spa.;
She might be a little more reserved than her friends, but when encouraged to, she will let loose and join in the fun. She seems to have stage fright, feeling uncomfortable with dancing in front of her friends, or talking in front of a camera. She doesn't seem to have as much thirst for adventure as her friends, avoiding scary situations that can potentially lead to danger (such as exploring a cave.) Although she might prefer to spend time at her relaxing and peaceful spa, she would never let a little thing like fear stop her, and won't hesitate to go on a mission.;
He is an earth elf - through and through. He is very grounded and has a strong bond with all earth and rock materials. He likes to see himself as the leader of the group, but he is really more a caring, nurturing type than captain material. He is very attached to his home and the plants he takes care of there.;
Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous.

However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary.;
Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races. Elves were agile, dexterous creatures. However, elves could move slightly faster than their eladrin kin and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Elves were also more preternaturally aware of their surroundings than eladrin, as well as possessing better common sense. This aided elves in many ways, allowing elves a high degree of perceptiveness that they could lend partially to allies. Additionally, elves were extremely accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids.;
Elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, though they were not usually considered past adolescence until they reached 110 years of age. Unlike humans, elves did not age dramatically as their lifespan came to a close, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening. Most elves remained healthy and full of life up until their death, which, if age-related, was usually between two and nine centuries.;
He is a lot stronger, both magically and personally than he thinks, responsible, kind, reliable, helpful, giving.;
Worries too much, can't help but collect things, doesn't always see social patterns clearly, very cautious in potential dangerous situations, gets in fights over leadership.;
He has a special bond with nature (on land), can make anything grow and thrive, can magically talk to plants and animals, is physically strong.;
Favorite things: Nature, plants, animals, musical instruments, seeds, bags, tools.;
He is logical, loyal, and down-to-earth. He will sometimes burst into long motivational speeches that the others tend to ignore. A stickler for safety, he will pay attention to rules and details that may escape his friends' notice. Even when he doesn't have all the answers, he will try to act like he knows what he's doing, so that the others will look up to him for leadership. He especially likes to eat delicious pastry foods made by the local elf.;
He has dark-brown hair that is slightly tousled. He also has light-green eyes, a fair complexion, and two Elf Tattoos - one, a green zigzag on his cheek, and the other, the earth insignia (a leaf with three points) on his shoulder.;
She was banished to the Specular Waters by her closest friend, and can now only speak through the waters of Specular Fountain. Supposedly, her friend created the Specular Waters as a gift for her, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. She has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. The Legend of she is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as she prepares to put her schemes into motion, the land of elves will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real.;
She has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead.;
As a Dark Elf, her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom.;
Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world.;
Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder. Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies. Elves are glamorous. They project glamour. Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment. Elves are terrific. They beget terror. The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. No one ever said elves are nice. Elves are bad.;
The Enchanted Forest's elves are long-lived even for elves. Those who avoid death can easily live to be a thousand years old. These elves are revered millenaries and their personal memories often outstrip the accuracy and depth of human accounts.;
The elves of the Enchanted Forest allied with one druid in the war against wizards.;
The Enchanted Forest's elves were great allies of the forces of good. Their culture produced many explorers, and their magic was attuned to every color of mana. The Enchanted Forest's elves organized into numerous different clans, each with their own leaders, called exarchs. Many Enchanted Forest's elves, followers of the human wizard, immigrated to the southern continent.;
The elves of the wilds part of Enchanted Forest have little in common with their kinfolk who have stayed in the Realm. They wear crowns of flowers and leaves in their hair and have clothing woven of flax and thistle. They are adept at hiding among the trees and attuned to the mana of the forests. Some of these elves actively hunt humans, just as they hunt deer and boars in the forest. Some call themselves knights, though the Realm would not recognize them as such. They ride giant foxes and wolves so they can bound through dense forests faster than any horse.;
There are many racial divisions of elves: gold elves, dark elves, moon elves, sea elves, wild elves, and winged elves. Elves are generally liked and even admired by humans and are easily accepted into their society. The same cannot be said for dwarves some of whom despise elves on principle.;
Winged elves have feathered wings and are capable of flight. They are more delicate than their earth-bound cousins, with hollow bones to aid their flight. They have pale skin and slightly larger than normal eyes.;
Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease.;
Elves are immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.;
Elves are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. ;
Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable. Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown.;
Elves are (generally) unusually beautiful in face and body. There is little physical difference between males and females except that which is required for reproduction. They have far better vision and hearing than Men. They also have skills and abilities beyond what is possible for Men, and many can craft seemingly magical objects. Elves possess ethereal grace and various powers. Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink.  They do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire. Although the Elves are more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them thus Elves do require sustenance.;
Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.;
Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes.;
FAERIE;
Faerie is a mythical being of romance usually having magic powers. It can appear as a creature typically having bright, shining clothes and hair.;
Freckles are really just the kisses of faeries.;
Faeries love honey cake, milk, nectar, and sweet butter.;
Faeries watch over and protect the natural world: woodlands, trees, rivers and growing things.;
Many faeries like to play practical (and sometimes not-so-practical) jokes on humans and even each other.;
Iron negates a faeries' magical powers and causes them pain.;
A sudden chill breeze, or ripples across the surface of water, are often indications that a faerie is nearby.;
Faeries can live to be hundreds of years old.;
Faerie is creature type used for cards that depict creatures with human appearance, often small stature, magical powers, and a penchant for trickery.;
The earliest, and most common, faerie in Lovey-dovey Land are winged humanoid creatures of diminutive size (sometimes a foot in height or smaller) that are renowned for being great lovers of mischief. These faeries exist through the multiverse. These are also sometimes known as fae, pixies or sprites.;
Big Faerie introduced larger sized Faeries, which inhabit the Wilds of Lovey-dovey Land alongside the smaller winged type. ;
Fire sprites are faeries who can cast fire spells and are perpetually surrounded by a flaming aura. They were summoned by the other elves while fighting.;
Faeries collect unusually valuable things: coins of fallen empires, baby teeth, and memories of treasured name.;
The fae of Lovey-dovey Land lead short, flitting lives in pursuit of gossip, diversions, and amusing intrigues. But faeries can also be carelessly cruel, capricious, and vindictive. The faeries travel in small groups of three to six called cliques. It is thought that faeries do not dream, which would explain why they spend so much time harvesting the dreams of others. Faeries can distill these stolen dreams into sparkling energy that they carry around with them.;
Wingless Lovey-Dovey Land faeries are called groundlings.;
Faeries are magical by nature and live in magical, pink biom called the Lovey-dovey Land.;
The oldest and strongest faeries are fallen angels.;
Faeries are quick to do you a favor and even quicker to demand payment for it.;
Some faeries are helpful. They guide travelers who are lost in the forest back towards home. They help with household chores, often going to work overnight, so that their hosts wake up to a happy surprise. If they are particularly fond of you, they might even lead you to treasure, give you magical gifts, help you win your true love hand in marriage, or cast a lucky charm over your life.;
Others are mischievous. They delight in misleading travelers or luring them into exhausting dances that go one for days. They also like to taunt domestic animals, pinching horses to make them gallop, stealing milk from cows, and playing cat-and-mouse with cats.;
It's important to be aware that most faeries have fluid personalities. They can go from helpful to mischievous quickly, and despite their cleverness, they don't have to have a reason for their decisions!;
As magical creatures, faeries have almost unlimited power. They can fly. They can make flowers bloom. They can conjure up gold. They can glow in the dark. They can create and cast new charms for any situation, and their curses can last for hundreds of years.;
Faeries come in many forms, and have been described as magical and mischievous beings from the realm next door. This realm is considered another dimension or reality. Faeries have been classified into two groups - one consisting of light faeries and the other dark ones. However, there have not been many details about identifying faerie classes.;
Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality, dark faeries are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal.;
The most common faeries are associated with one of the six elements. The elemental faeries can control the forces of earth, air, water, light, fire and darkness.;
The Fair Folk are known for their unearthly beauty, many faeries said to be extremely attractive with delicate and regal faces. Though they mostly resemble human beings, some have extraordinary features such as wings, horns, oddly colored-eyes or skin. A common aspect among them is their pointed ears. Faeries commonly incorporate flora and multiple forms of vegetation as part of their ensemble.;
As time typically flows differently for them and in their realm, they are very long-lived and become only more artful and powerful as they age, though they are not immortal.;
They are known for their cunning and their cruel sense of humor, and they especially delight in tricking other creatures. Therefore, even though their land is beautiful, hardly anyone goes there. They frequently seek to bargain with others, offering someone their heart's desire but failing to mention that the desire comes with a terrible cost. They are committed to notions of honor and etiquette, and while faeries always exactly follow the letter of any promise they have made, they deliver these results with great irony and often use clever wordplay to their advantage in order to create loopholes.;
The Fair Folk are also unable to lie. They might, however, tell what they believe is true, even if it is not. They may also expertly weave lies into sentences by using methods such as not telling the whole truth, letting others assume things, or not correcting the people with whom they're speaking. Faeries are also capable of manipulating one another.There have apparently been times when these either playful or serious manipulations, specifically resulting from problems or conflicts between rival courts, bleed into the world.;
Despite being described as dangerous, she does not appear to be evil, as she was willing to help an orphaned, and advise them to avoid a dangerous supernatural being. She is very mysterious and reclusive, avoiding others.;
Long red hair, emerald green eyes, shirtless, red and purple rings around his left arm, yellow petal like pattern pants, black lining on top, barefoot;
She has large, glowing green eyes, dark green hair and pale green, leaf-like wings. Dressed in a long dark green cloak, she can blend into the forest. She lives in Lovey-dovey Land, the beautiful and colorful land of all faeries;
She was a dark faerie, however, she was not evil. Some magic hypnotized her and she was forced to help free the great enemy, an ancient beast of magma awakened from a volcano. The amulet was guarding was destroyed and she was no longer under the enemy control, she then was erased from existence. ;
It is speculated that they all have a number of common abilities within them, like magical knowledge (being able to cast magic thanks to their knowledge and nature), invisibility (as they can hide from humans who have not been to the faerie Realm), enhanced strength, possibly immortality, and telekinesis (the ability to move objects with their minds). However, special abilities could also be limited to some kind of faeries, like flying (as tinks have wings).;
Some faeries have the ability to send someone pleasant dreams. It is considered a faerie gift.;
Faeries have long life spans, longer than other mortals and have the ability to choose when they die. They live in Lovey-dovey Land and don't migrate to other lands by their wings, only by teleportation skills.;
They are strongly magical and some of them are even immortal.;
Aside from the immortal, most fey live for upward of 300 years, and they change forms (including gender) based on their innermost feelings, so that the most unstable of fey can wildly change their type almost a dozen times over the course of their lives. Two fey can have children of different types than themselves.;
Magical Beings.;
They appear to be sensitive to energy, as one of them made the comment that fairies are all about energy.;
In addition, it seems they also suffer from arithmomania, a mental disorder that may be seen as an expression of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Sufferers of this disorder have the overwhelming impulse to count their actions or objects in their surroundings. Because of this (and regardless of how powerful any fairy may be), it must stop what it is doing to count every grain of sugar or salt, one by one, if someone pours it in front of them.;
Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality they are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal.;
Fairies are incredibly powerful magical beings, being apparently all about energy.;
They can only be seen if they want to be. This ability continues to work, even after the fairy in question's death, meaning humans who haven't been to the fairy realm can't see their remains.;
Able to cast vivid and convincing illusions in order to trick others, as demonstrated with the illusion on the fae world, making it appear more appealing and beautiful. This ability is very similar to their shapeshifting ability if not the same.;
Faeries specialize in the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or a far away location. Faeries are notable for possessing an unusually high wisdom from wizards, with strong and cautious judgment, preferring to use violence only as a last resort. Many faeries are also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all matters.;
Faeries are not necessarily cowards but exhaust all other options before proceeding into combat. While faeries can be useful due to their anticipation of others' attacks some are irritatingly hesitant, making them nigh useless at times. When forced into battle, faeries are in natural opposition to illusionists, whose tricks they can unravel with their own spells.;
Some fairies, even some of the most ugly and horrifying, can be benevolent and helpful. Other fairies can be evil and malicious, even some of the most beautiful. What they have in common is that all fairies are considered to be both mischievous and capricious. They love to play tricks and their attitude can change from happy or friendly to ferocious without warning if they are somehow offended.;
WIZARD;
Your soul is inundated with power. Let it overflow, and your enemies will quickly learn to fear it. Wizards are a type of magic user. Athletic, affable, and self-assured, wizards hardly seem like scholarly bibliophiles hidden away from civilization. They possess many of the same skills as the male members of the magic clans, but excel at the use of elemental magic. Like most mages, they consider melee combat vulgar.;
Wizard is a battle-ready warrior for whom faith is a shield, and fights for what he believes to be right. His steadfastness gives him powers to bestow blessings to his friends and wreak cruel justice on foes. There are those who call the wizard an overwrought zealot, but others recognize in him the strength and goodness of the light.;
Originally from the lands of the west, the knights of the faith, also known as wizards.;
Wizards work with their allies more closely than some of the more single-minded wizard variants and this is one of their strengths. Wizards use their spells to overcome social obstacles, convince enemies to lay down arms, or put foes into a daze. The most dangerous ability of an wizard is their ability to turn an enemy into an ally, or vice versa, or to incapacitate an enemy in such a way that renders them as good as dead.;
Wizards can be good or evil and have no overall strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters are chaotic over evil, though only by a slim margin. Good wizards are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another's being's free will, while evil enchanters show little such restraint.;
Wizard's magic is a unique blend of arcane magic with the elemental power of creation and those who specialize in it are known as evokers. Wizards are often stubbornly determined by nature and have little use for distractions of the real world, living in very often spartan conditions. Many wizards are decisive and forthright, who are sure of what they must do, be it good or evil, giving them many qualities of strong leadership.;
Wizard are naturally adept at combat, making them some of the most common wizard adventurers. Most evocation spells have an immediately obvious combat application, such as magic missile or fireball and make evokers valued combatants who often serve as a form of magical artillery on the battlefield.;
Wizards were a form of a spellcaster who learned the art of arcane magic through research and learning.  What wizards lacked in combat prowess and armor they made up with a broad range of magical spells and abilities learned through years of practice and training. Through their spellcasting ability, powerful wizards could control the battlefield, using spells that affected wide areas, often hindering enemies, while also learning to use powerful rituals of arcane power.;
When casting spells, wizards often used arcane accessories, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands. These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically.;
Wizards were also skilled in the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells which a wizard can only master once per day), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual.;
A familiar was a normal animal that gained new powers and became a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard.;
Wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. In particular, they learn most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their spellbooks, a method that allows them, unlike bards or sorcerers, to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards see themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, and scientists, studying a system of natural laws that are for the most part unknown and undiscovered.;
This is the common view of a wizard casting: voicing several strange words, utilizing some arcane component (such as tossing pixie dust into the air), and perhaps making some sort of quirky hand movement. In actuality every part of the sequence must be exact or else the wizard may miscast, misfire, cast an entirely different spell, or cast nothing at all.;
A wizard still in his apprentice stage.Wizards may specialize in one or more of eight schools of magic, choosing their specialty early on in their training. This specialization is sometimes required in order to join the ranks of some of the world's most prestigious wizards, such as the Great Wizards of Misty Swamp, who require all initiates to be specialized in one of the schools of magic.;
Specialist wizards are treated and regarded as wizards by the world at large in spite of this specialization and many regarded themselves as such, though sometimes distinctions are made for diviners, illusionists, and necromancers. ;
Wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or interact with other spells, are known as abjurers. These wizards are usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. They like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters.;
These wizards in battle are not as much a danger to those who forego magic for martial combat but those who use arcane or even divine spells will find abjurers deadly opponents. As aforementioned abjurers are often well-prepared for combating spellcasters of all stripes and are a valuable addition to any team intent on fighting wielders of supernatural abilities.;
Stereotypes of faeries and wizards are often similar, they tend to see magic as a blunt instrument. In battle, they do tend to be unflinching in danger, confident in their summoned power to overcome any threat.;
The typical Swamp Wizard is chaotic in alignment and in a reversal of the wizard stereotype favor quick and easy solutions over long and carefully planned out ones. Many are also evil or neutral, unperturbed by paths to power that involve unsavory, evil or outright despicable methods. Most Swamp Wizards like isolation, as it means they can carry out their dangerous experiments undisturbed by others and only leave their enclaves either to accumulate more power or the necessary wealth to continue their research.;
Bein' a wizard means knowin' power can flow in more than one direction.;
The wizard (or magician) is a damage-dealing spell-caster that specializes in burst damage and area of effect spells. Mages are well known for their formidable damage output, as well as their range of crowd control abilities. Mages are also capable of performing a number of utility roles, from conjuring refreshments for their allies to teleporting or opening Portals to major cities.;
Wizards wear only cloth armor, but compensate for this with a range of armor spells, wreathing themselves in flame, frost or even arcane energies. Nonetheless, when fighting melee opponents, wizards stay alive by incapacitating attackers and always keeping one step ahead - and well out of reach. Wizards are quick and can blink away from attackers, use invisibility to slip into the shadows. Wizards are masters of kiting, and can use their enviable range of snares and crowd control abilities to defeat whole groups of opponents without putting a hair out of place.;
A Wizard gains their spellcasting power by making a deal with a demon or another dark being.;
Wizards of Misty Swamp are humans who chose to live in the wilds, so far removed from humanity that they might as well be fair folk. They are usually cruel but can sometimes be seen as a ruthless force for justice.;
A number of black-aligned spellcrafters are called wizards (though some are shamans instead of wizards). Some are necromancers, others make demonic pacts.;
Misty Swamp wizards are mostly green and white-aligned warlocks that follow primordial, pagan traditions. After their leader's death they have taken to organising large festivities, hoping to beat back the darkness and lengthen the days. Members of the coven seem to have made a pact with a god.;
Wizards of Misty Swamp can utilize their skill to ensure that enemies focus on them, defending weaker members of their group. Their potent healing abilities ensure that their allies remain in fighting shape and can be resurrect, while they charge their weapons with holy might, allowing them to deal additional damage with their strikes. As champions of order, wizards are extremely potent in a group - their blessings and auras can improve damage and survivability for both themselves and their party, while withstanding heavy physical damage with plate armor and strong defensive abilities.;
Wizards talents increase their ability to heal the wounded, strengthen their capacity to protect their companions, and allow them to deal out vicious damage in the name of justice.;
This is the call of the wizard: to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. The light grants wizards additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer.;
Wizards are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the light would shine upon. The light radiates from wizards, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power.;
Good Wizards do battle to protect the world from the forces of shadow. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the light to heal wounds, create shields of force, and incinerate evil creatures. ;
Good Wizards are champions who call upon the light to heal wounds and combat evil.;
Good Wizards are bastions of divine light, meting out justice with magic and might.;
Evil Wizards do battle to spread the shadows into the world. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the evil creatures and shadows which would serve them in the battle.;
Evil Wizards are dark avengers who call upon the darkness to spread evil and conquer the world.;
Evil Wizards are hosts of dark forces, sowing pestilence and horror.;

A master of the javelin and bow, the amazon reacts to combat situations with superhuman agility. She relies on magic prowess to enhance her significant martial abilities.The amazon is a powerful woman warrior of the Specular Waters, who belongs to nomadic bands who roam the plains near the Specular Waters. The wandering of these groups often brings them into conflict with other peoples, so the amazon is accustomed to fighting to defend.;
The druids are a nomadic race who hail from the untamed lands of Enchanted Forest. Rugged and beautiful, the home of the druids is teeming with werewolves and other abominations lurking within the encroaching wilderness. To survive and rule over these wilds, the druids must forfeit their humanity to awaken the beast within. The druids are a race of nomadic warrior-poet-kings. They are shapeshifters, they can change into their spirit animal.;
All that I am: anger, cruelty, vengeance - I bestow upon you, my chosen knight. I have granted you immortality so that you may herald in a new, dark age for the scourge.;
Death knights are melee fighters that wield dark magic and rune forged weapons.;
Death knights engage their foes up-close, supplementing swings of their weapons with dark magic that renders enemies vulnerable or damages them with unholy power. They drag foes into one-on-one conflicts, compelling them to focus their attacks away from weaker companions. To prevent their enemies from fleeing their grasp, death knights must remain mindful of the power they call forth from runes, and pace their attacks appropriately. To protect themselves and their fellows from death in battle, death knights gird themselves in heavy armor and parry attacks with their blades. They have a personal connection with their blades, and can forge runes into them in order to increase their power, these runeblades are empowered with dark magic and they can expend the power of their runes for vicious attacks.;
Death knight talents can bolster their defensive abilities by focusing on their ability to heal themselves, increase their damage and spell attacks, or summon forth minions and diseases by making use of their runes.;
Primary death knight attributes are strength and stamina. Most important secondary attributes are usually haste and critical strike, though certain specializations and rotations may favor mastery.;
When the king's control of his death knights was broken, his former champions sought revenge for the horrors committed under his command. After their vengeance was won, the death knights found themselves without a cause and without a home. One by one they trickled into the land of the living in search of a new purpose. Frost sharpens their strikes blood fortifies their bodies and undeath allows them to erupt in unholy rage in the heat of battle. A thousand atrocities are etched in the eyes of every death knight, and foes who gaze into them too long will feel the warmth pulled from their bodies, replaced with cold steel.;
Ten thousand years ago, the night elves founded a vast empire, but their reckless use of primal magic brought them to ruin. In grief, they withdrew to the forests and remained isolated there until the return of their ancient enemy. With no other choice, the night elves emerged at last from their seclusion to fight for their place in the new world.An ancient and mystical race, the once-immortal elves have had a hand in shaping centuries of history. They are bound inextricably to the natural forces around them and live a self-sufficient, reclusive lifestyle.For ten thousand years, the immortal night elves cultivated a druidic society within the shadowed recesses of Ashenvale Forest. Yet recently, the catastrophic invasion of the Burning Legion shattered the tranquility of their ancient civilization. Led by the Arch-Druid Malfurion Stormrage and the Priestess Tyrande Whisperwind, the mighty night elves rose to challenge the demonic onslaught. Though victorious, the night elves were forced to sacrifice their cherished immortality and watch their beloved forests burn. Seeking to regain their immortality, a number of wayward druids conspired to plant a special tree that would reestablish a link between their spirits and the eternal world. Despite Malfurion's warning that nature would never bless such a selfish act. The druids planted the great tree, Teldrassil, off the stormy coasts of northern Kalimdor. Among the twilight boughs of the colossal tree, the wondrous city of Darnassus took root. However, the great tree was not consecrated with nature's blessing and soon fell prey to the corruption of the Burning Legion. Now the wildlife and even the limbs of the great tree itself are tainted by a growing darkness. It is your sworn duty to defend Darnassus and the wild children of nature against the Legion's encroaching corruption.After years of imprisonment within the Emerald Nightmare, Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage has finally returned to the mortal world. Reunited with his love, Tyrande Whisperwind, Malfurion endeavors now to heal the corrupted world tree, Teldrassil, and rejuvenate the spirit of the night elf people. Yet, as the great cataclysm shakes the boughs of their colossal tree, the night elves brace themselves against the coming storm. As war and destruction close in from all sides, is falls to night elves like you to stand strong and protect the enduring legacy of your people. Amongst the oldest races on elves, this ancient people saw the world nearly sundered by their own reckless use of magic. Forsaking the primal magics of their past, the elves then went on to live harmoniously with nature. After thousands of years in isolation, the night elves eventually made contact with the younger races and found common goals alongside them, resulting in their alliance with the races of men, dwarves, and gnomekind.;
They start in Misty Swamp, an area located inside the great world. The elven capital was Misty Swamp Residence, where their queen and her husband led their people. After the great boughs of their home were burned down by the horde, however, night elves canonically have no main base of operations. The night elves has long rode the mighty nightsaber, and their racial language is elfish. The common tongue is a secondary language they share with their allies.;
For the alliance, the druid class was exclusive to the night elves.;
Barbarians are combatants who fight alone or in loose hordes. Unlike soldiers, whose strength is in their numbers, a single barbarian is often content to take on the world all by him- or herself. Barbarians favor brute strength over cunning, sheer will over tactics. Many barbbarians have trample.;
Druids, like clerics, are masters of magic that are powered by faith, often backed up with prowess in combat. They are nature priests and mostly green-aligned. Druids are strongly tied to plants, animals, fertility, the element of earth, and the land about them.;
Druids often congregate in groups away from civilization. The vast majority of druids wield green mana, but some channel white or black mana as well. Green-aligned races such as elves produce many druids.;
Elvish druids, respected for their wisdom, are the leaders of elf bands. When situations arise that concern the elves as a group, a council of all the druids convene to solve the problem. No single druid holds authority over the council, but by longstanding tradition, the five eldest druids hold seats of honor-representing the five magical sites of their ancient realm.;
Enchantresses or enchanters are a particular kind of druid specializing in shaping enchantments.;
