Suddenly I don't feel like fighting.
Why am I fighting?
I really don't want to fight.
I see no reason to keep fighting.
This fight makes no sense.
I'm not interested in fighting anymore.
I see no reason to fight.
There's no reason to fight.
I'm staying out of this.
This fight is pointless.
