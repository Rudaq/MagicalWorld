Fairies are small creatures with powerful magic that are often overlooked. Fairies magic overflows from them in the form of magic dust. Fairies have excess magic dust and can give it to those who show they have a pure heart. To show you have a pure heart you need to kill the gorilla and bring its heart. Fairies need gorilla heart because it can be a good protection and it can make other enemies withdraw from attacking.
