May you walk on warm sands.
May the gods watch over your battles
May your next fight bring you victory
May the fates be kind upon you.
May you die with a sword in your hands.
May your enemy boil your blood and grind your bones.
Take care.
Fight well.
It's been a pleasure.
See you around.
I'd better get going.
Now go away!
We are done here.
You have entertained me enough for today
Be safe.
You're going to need a lot of practice.
I'm sure we'll meet again.
May we meet again.
Farewell!

Be just and true (...and only good will come to you).
May the Peaceful One comfort you all the days of your life.
I wish goodness to envelop you this night.
Look to the stars for guidance.
Go in good health.
May your aim be true.
God protection be upon you
Until next time.
