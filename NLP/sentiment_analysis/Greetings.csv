They say you're strong	1
Did you even try to brush your hair today?	0
I'm feeling fresh today.	1
I thought you'd be taller.	0
Have you seen an ogre yet? I want to ride on the back of one!	1
I embody contentedness.	1
You are overflowing with a blessing of stupendous prosperity!!	1
Excessive health and happiness gush from your very being!	1
You are giving off positive energy	1
Have you a garden of four-leaf clovers? You are bursting with essences of great fortune!	1
I sense a speck of good karma about you	1
There's something unusually warm about you. I'm not sure how to place it	1
The air feels dull and gloomy where you step. Be wary of ill feelings.	1
Is something bothering you? Something doesn't feel quite right about you.	1
Negative energy is seeping from your pores. I wouldn't take any chances today.	0
Unfortunate omens hang over your head.	0
Stay away! You are dragging a behemoth of woeful bad luck in your wake! I want nothing of it!!	0
Did you smash every mirror in the world!? You hapless fool	0
Finally	1
All neural functions appear to be operating smoothly.	1
I really appreciate all the good you've done for this land! Thank you!	1

Soar like an Eagle.	1
Welcome to our free world.	1
Let me look upon your beauty.	1
Look to the moons.	1
By the light of the night, all will be right.	1
I will wait for you until the deer takes up the bow.	1
Have no fear to sleep this night, (the Night watchman is here to ensure morning's light).	1
Disobedience is death.	0
Nothing last forever but the elements.	1
What business have we?	1
Time is the master of all men.	1
One never knows what lies over the next hill, so go and see.	1
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.	1
Go for it. What do you have to lose?	1
If you can't laugh with them, slug them.	1
It's not whether you win or lose,...(it's how you bend the rules)	1
My words are your thoughts, we are one.	1
Our enemies will be crushed in the fist of the Oppressor.	1
The black void is near.	1
See the darkness.	1
Blessed are the blind.	1
Better than a sharp stick in the eye.	1
Life is pain.	0
When the Ruler calls, all beings answer.	1
Guard your soul well,...(lest it become mine).	1
A Pox on you and your kindred.	0
Its a fine, foul day for battle.	0
Better bad luck than no luck at all.	1
Ho, Traveller!	1
We Come In Peace.	1
Stay Warm, Mate.	1
Hold it right there!	1

Fairest and fallen, greeting and defiance.	1
