How are you doing today?
How are things?
Long time no see.
How are you doing this fine evening?
Look who it is!
Nice to see you again.
Sup?
Look what the cat dragged in!
Look what the dragon dragged in!
"Oh no, look who it is!"
"Hey, howdy, hi!"
Ahoy!
What's kickin'?
Top of the mornin' to ya!
What's crackin'?
"At least, we meet for the first time for the last time!"
Here's Johnny!
I know you!
Oh I know who that is.
"Oh, it's you'"
What do you want?
Who dares to come here?
Who dares to  disrupt my peace?
Get away now!
You better watch out!
Look what the wind threw in.
Greetings and salutations.
"What's up with you, old soul?"
Hi mate.
"How's life treating you, my friend?"
It's been ages.
"How long it's been, friend?"
How is life sailing?
Hey! I saw you eons ago.
What's the word?
What's the latest buzz in your world?
How's things?
Never thought I would see you again.
"Told you, not to come here."
You didn't heed my warning. Now you must die!
Hey Einstein! Solved that problem yet?
Didn't expect you to be so stupid to come here.
Beautiful morning!
A star shines on the hour of our meeting.
Hello. Goodbye.
Salutations!
May truth walk with you.
May the force be with you.
"Wish I could say it's nice to see you, but it's not."
It was a great morning until you came around.
You want help? Go somewhere else!
What's wrong with you?
What the hell do you want?
"You! In the flesh, as I live and breathe!"
So' we meet at last.
"This ends here, my old friend."
I thought I told you to get out of town'
This town ain't big enough for the two of us.
So we meet again.
Looking for trouble?
What does a horse eat? Hayyyyy.
What did one plant say to the other? Aloe! Long thyme no see.
How much does a polar bear weigh? Enough to break the ice ' how are you?
How does the sea say hello? It waves. [Waving].
"Hello darkness, my old friend."
Get out of my piece of land!
Thought I told you not to come here!
Should've avoided this place.
Don't you have any self-preservation?
What possible reason could you have to visit me?
Don't come any closer!
It's your last warning. Go away!
Leave me be.
You want something? Guess you'll have to kill me first.
"Why are you seeking me, you fool?"
Heard you were looking for me?
Can I help you?
"You seem lost, do you need help?"
"Hey you, are you alright?"
You need something? Maybe I can help.
Think you have what it takes to convince me to help you?
I know who you are. Better run away! 
Do you have a death wish?
Talk. I don't have much time.
"I see you're hell-bent on self-destruction. Come on, say what you have to say."
Want my help? Then convince me.
I'm listening. I don't have all day.
Be careful what you say next. You're life depends on it.
You think I'm a fool? I'm not helping you.
I come in peace. Do you?
"What are you seeking, my friend?"
What is it that you want?
"What are you looking for, my friend?"
You! What are the chances of meeting you here!
Run now and I will start my hunt!
Why are you here?
What have you got for sale?
Hmm?
Need something?
Hmm hmm.
Yes?
All right
Ours is to smile at your passing
It fills us with rage. What harm does it bring to us now?
You have questions?
Tidings.
It is our most favoured company.
It annoys us. What does it want to take from us now?
You've been a good friend to me. That means something.
Yeah?
Huh?
I should bash your face in after all you've done.
You're the best! Can you be my father/mother?
You're mean. I hate you. I hate you forever and ever and ever.
I bet you could slay one of those mean old dragons. I bet you could do anything.
I hope monsters come and eat you.
Good to have you by my side
I'll take my leave
I don't like talking to someone who holds their honour so cheaply.
I'm waiting.
Out with it.
You're someone who can get things done. I like that.
You have something to say
Good to see you again
What do you want? You've caused enough trouble.
Now here's a man/woman I'm glad to see.
You. What do you want?
Good to see you. Finally someone useful is around.
Something you need?
Speak.
Make it quick.
Friends like you are hard to find and very valuable to me.
Now why would I want to talk to you?
You! You're going to hurt me again aren't you? Just stay away.
Y...Yes?
You want something from me?
Divines bless you. May the ground you walk quake as you pass.
I don't mean you any trouble. Just leave me alone.
Azura's wisdom to you
Filth. Run to the horizon before I hunt you down.
And what might you need? Hmm?
We're one of the same kind
There are so many delightful ways I've pictured you dead.
My favorite drinking buddy. Let's get some mead.
I don't owe you money
What are you starin' at?
Gods strike you down.
So nice to have pleasant company for a change.
Make it quick.
You want something from me?
Speak quickly.
There are so few pleasures in life as fine as your company.
Absolutely no time to deal with lowlifes these days. Go away.
Divines smile on you
You want to talk to me? After everything you've done?
I hope the wilds claim you one of these days.
These sands are cold
Khajiit wishes for you to go away. You have done us too much harm.
How can I assist
This one needs something?
Aye.
Speak. Khajiit will listen until all the sugars in the world turn sour.
Its scent is foul
May the gods watch over your battles
A fine day to you
The gods know what you've done.
You're not as dumb as you look.
Leave me alone. Can't an old man have some peace?
Come.
Let’s hear it.
Here to shame an old woman? Leave me be.
Good to see your people still have such fine people. You give an old man hope.
Just looking at you makes me upset.
Well hello.
I hope your parents are proud of you. They have a lot of reason to be.
You're just rotten. No good.
What're you lookin' at?
What do you want? Aren't your hands coated with enough blood?
What now...
This better be good...
Good to see you. At least you know how to treat someone properly.
Worthless. Everyone like you is completely worthless.
Got somethin' to say?
I'm all ears.
I've had just about all I'm willing to take from you. What is it?
Is there... something I can do for you?
You're nothing but trouble.
It's a fine day with you around.
You. Every time I look at you my blood boils.
Greetings. Is there something I can help you with?
Lovely morning
Eww... What happened to your face?
I don't think I like your tone.
Why are you even here? You don't need to be here. Get out.
Quit wasting my time.
Stop staring!
It's a good day to die!
You might want to be careful today.
Wha? Who might you be?
You are done.
So two goblins walk into a bar…
They say you're strong
Did you even try to brush your hair today?
I'm feeling fresh today.
I thought you'd be taller.
Have you seen an ogre yet? I want to ride on the back of one!
I embody contentedness.
You are overflowing with a blessing of stupendous prosperity!!
Excessive health and happiness gush from your very being!
You are giving off positive energy
Have you a garden of four-leaf clovers? You are bursting with essences of great fortune!
I sense a speck of good karma about you
There's something unusually warm about you. I'm not sure how to place it
The air feels dull and gloomy where you step. Be wary of ill feelings.
Is something bothering you? Something doesn't feel quite right about you.
Negative energy is seeping from your pores. I wouldn't take any chances today.
Unfortunate omens hang over your head.
Stay away! You are dragging a behemoth of woeful bad luck in your wake! I want nothing of it!!
Did you smash every mirror in the world!? You hapless fool
Finally
All neural functions appear to be operating smoothly.
I really appreciate all the good you've done for this land! Thank you!
All matters are well at hand
What’s the good word?
Heeeeelo!
Prepare to die!
See you in Hell.
Aren't you dead yet?
Yeah. Bye.
Scared?
Didn't I take care of you last time?
Don't show fear they can smell fear.
You honour my presence.
May honour go with you.
Be just and true (...and only good will come to you).
Push the day into the night
May the Peaceful One comfort you all the days of your life.
I wish goodness to envelop you this night.
Look to the stars for guidance.
Soar like an Eagle.
Welcome to our free world.
Let me look upon your beauty.
Look to the moons.
"By the light of the night, all will be right."
I will wait for you until the deer takes up the bow.
"Have no fear to sleep this night, (the Night watchman is here to ensure morning's light)."
Disobedience is death.
Nothing last forever but the elements.
What business have we?
Time is the master of all men.
"One never knows what lies over the next hill, so go and see."
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
Go for it. What do you have to lose?
"If you can't laugh with them, slug them."
"It's not whether you win or lose,...(it's how you bend the rules)"
"My words are your thoughts, we are one."
Our enemies will be crushed in the fist of the Oppressor.
The black void is near.
See the darkness.
Blessed are the blind.
Better than a sharp stick in the eye.
Life is pain.
"When the Ruler calls, all beings answer."
"Guard your soul well,...(lest it become mine)."
A Pox on you and your kindred.
"Its a fine, foul day for battle."
Better bad luck than no luck at all.
"Ho, Traveller!"
We Come In Peace.
"Stay Warm, Mate."
Hold it right there!
Pestilence pass us!
"Fairest and fallen, greeting and defiance."
You have something to say dog? Something on your mind?
Something you need you miserable wretch?
Yes yes. I haven’t got all day…
Oh it’s you. I was wondering why I was smelling something unpleasant.
