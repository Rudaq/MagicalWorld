"Occasionally trips over his beard, then angrily insists that that is an attractive feature back under the mountain.Stingy... except around women, whom he is greatly concerned with impressing. Wields a hammer because his father was a smith. And while that profession was not for him, he still honors his family every time he goes to battle. Obsessed with finding rubies. Will take a hand full of rubies over a chest full of gold any day. Secretly hates beer as it's too bitter. Drinks rum instead. Is very attracted to halflings, vastly more so then to other dwarves. But they'd never let their parents find out. Constantly 'chalks up' their hands with dirt or dust from rocks to better their grip on their weapon. Scared of goblins, but does everything humanly possibly to deny this.",,,,
"Believes he was chosen by Moradin to do something important. But has no idea what it is...for now. Can't let a dare or slight against his courage slip by him. Always bites when someone calls him a chicken. Likes to hum 'Heigh Ho' to themselves. When asked why, they fervently deny it saying, 'I was not.' Has an obsession with staking claims throughout the adventure in search of ore and gems. Has personalized metal spikes. Actually likes elves ever as one saved them as a child. Is very tall for a dwarf (5'0') and proudly boasts about this often, even when in the company of races much taller than him. Likes to keep/store spare tools in his beard. Obviously dyes their beard. There are streaks of gray that have been colored to match their original shade, but don't exactly match. Vigorously denies that they dye their beard. Decorates their equipment with menacing spikes. While they look rusty, they are of the highest  quality craftsmanship. Doesn't actually drink alcohol. They just case prestidigitation on water to look and taste like alcohol. Convinced that a pick-axe is the best melee weapon. Dislikes wearing shoes and prefers to be closer to the earth. Often tries to show off his feet calluses. Always picks their teeth with a sliver of a stone from their home.",,,,
"Tends to be more curious when encountering monstrous humanoids (Orcs, Goblins, etc.) rather than outright hostile. Always carries around a small personal cask of ale for 'emergencies'. Is concerned with filling it immediately after it empties, holds 4 servings of ale. Has ornate metal bands adorning their beard, of brass and bronze, decorated to pay homage to the adventures they have been on so far. Talks constantly of their family's prowess at brewing ale. Is usually snacking on some form of hard cheese or salted meat. Grimmaces and complains when they are outside for too long and haven't been in a cave, mine, or other underground area for longer than 1d8 days. Keeps a record of the giants they've killed with notches in their axe or war hammer handle. (Can be any other type of creature.)",,,,
"She/he can't understand complicated plans, or they refuse to try. It should be plain and simple, otherwise she/he drools or something of the like. The axe goes in the head of the evil guy and the hammer breaks his bones. What else do you need? Builds tiny warforged servants (limited-sentience). Calls them his babies. Incredibly and uncomfortably affectionate when drunk. Refuses to wear or wield non-dwarven arms and armor. Has a metal lower jaw after an unfortunate forge accident. As a result their mouth is always slightly open and the tinniest bit crooked... just enough to irritate the obsessive compulsive. He cannot grow a beard, only a moustache.",,,,
"Carries around a small etching of his/her beautiful/handsome (subjective) wife/husband. Likes to show it off to everyone at every opportunity they get. Reacts badly to anyone who doesn't praise their partners luscious beard. Has a large nose that turns red whenever it's cold outside or when he's drunk. Hates being called 'Rudolph'. He is very bigoted towards the underdark and everyone/thing from there. Will often blame problems on the surface world on the underdark. 'Political corruption? Probably a mind flayer. Those things are real you know. The underdark, such an awful place.' He actively collects children's trading cards and occasionally plays in city tournaments. He's rather joyful about discussing it too among his non-dwarven friends, but always 'forgets' his deck when drawves show up. Has gotten into verbal arguments over card rules with children before. Likes reading history, especially about heroes and battles that are often overlooked in traditional history books. (Prof in History)",,,,
"Carries a flask of infinite ale around with them, however, they never seem to be drunk. (It's water) Is missing an eye/ Replaced it with a chunk of gold craved to look like an eye. Yells unique expletives when angry, such as 'Balldersmith!', 'Haggis!' or 'SON OF AN ELF!' hates heights. actively avoids climbing unless they must. Is petrified of open water. Can't swim. Skin is so rough that he can light a match on any part of his body. Has large hands for someone his size.Hair grows on his knuckles. Carrying things are much easier, as is crushing eggs. Thinks mind flayers don't exist; just rumors and urban legends. Scoffs at the idea of slaad's too. Skilled at playing a harp due to lessons their mother made them take as a child. Is deeply embarrassed by this as harp-players are supposed to be romantic fortune tellers in their clan. Attempts to wrestles beasts/animals before hitting them with a weapon. Uses dyes made of crushed gems and similar substances to dye hair and beard wild colours.",,,,
"Has a stooped posture out of shame for their unnaturally tall and un-dwarf-like body. Takes precautions against being out in daylight for too long out of fear for its effects. All the above ground races are constantly exposed to it, after all, and they can't grow decent beards to save their life. Carries (does not wear) a copper ring with intricate carvings on its circumference. It is obviously important to them, but they're reluctant to say why. Has an intense fascination for plants. Likes flowers the most, with an especial interest for lilies. Has a small pet bird for a companion, enjoys whistling songs with it. Boisterous and happy to brawl, tends to engage in violent pasttimes and drunken fights for pleasure.

Pretends to be knowledgeable in a lot of domains out of their expertise. talks in his sleep. Has a tendency to admit embarrassing things late at night. Collects random animal parts, herbs, spices, and other unique ingredients in an attempt to craft the best ale in the world. Loves this hobby. Carries around a small piece of rock and will throw it at opponents in an attempt to distract them for a tick.",,,,
"grew up under a desert. As a result, they're fascinated by ponds and rivers. They like spending their down time by a source of water and can stare at lakes for hours. Carries around their own beer stein (its 2 to 3 times the size of a regular one) and will only drink from it. Having spent the vast majority of their lives underground they are fascinated by the weather, and keep meticulous notes on it day in and day out. Is scared of horses. He will never ride one because they're 'so high up'. Oddly enough, he's fine with climbing mountains. Claims they can read the history of a stone simply by touching, licking, and examining the stone closely. Then creates elaborate stories for said stone (which may or may not be exaggerated). Will do this for stone buildings, random pebbles, mountains, any stone really.",,,,
"Secretly appreciates elven made weaponry and dreams of learning from a master elven smith. There best child hood friend was a goblin, this is never revealed, would hide and play with the goblin growing up. Stories of their adventures are flavored as though the goblin was an imaginary creature. Was friends with a half-orc as a child. Now has a very soft spot for them. Will fight orcs to the death no problem. Always has to sleep with a rock under there pillow, otherwise they have a horrible nights rest, and wake up on the wrong side of the bed the next morning. Is very understanding that not everyone can grow a beard, but scoffs at those that shave butcher their own beards. Claims that they are fastest dwarf alive, and that they can move more than 25ft in a turn. (No they can't - DM). Has 15 siblings. At least one drops in unannounced every week, and they fill up the house/hut/guild hall during the holidays. Carries a peculiar small stone golem with rubies for eyes. claims it is just a doll from his/her childhood mountain, but attunement and magical energies suggest otherwise.",,,,
"Old dwarf (350-380 years old) wears a pair of spectacles with stone rims. Handcrafted and very old. Emblazoned with rubies and lesser gems. Grants low-light vision only in caves and mountain passes. Honors their deep dwarf roots by lighting the end of their braids or moustache on fire before battle to intimidate enemies. Regrets serving their old god and is looking for a new one. Treats all Gnomes and Halflings as Dwarf babies. is an avid wrestler, both the sport and the scripted spectacle. Knows all the underground wrestlers and where/when the biggest matches will be held. Goes every chance he/she gets. Won't eat anything that is not 'Dwarven Cuisine'. Is convinced that everything good was invented by dwarves - and likes to tell this to anyone, willing to listen or not. thinks magical classes are unworthy. A real fight has no shortcuts. Always makes puns about magic users and how they are not able to do things the ordinary way.",,,,
"Plays bagpipes at sunrise every holy day of the week. Hates (choose a race). If something bad happens he accuses that race for it even if there where none around. Always makes puns about the weakness, the size and the magical traits of this race. Immediately becomes friends with people who paysfor his drinks. Why are your ears so pointy?' I asked. 'Why is your nose so big?' They said. I miss that stupid elf. Claims to be a heir of a former king (He's not.). This dwarf has multiple spouses. Because of their upbringing, they start every fight by throwing a stone. Either to incapacitate an enemy or distract them. 'I'll stop doing it when it stops working.' is their response. Thinks the end of days will come in their lifetime. Thus, they are extremely cautious to engage in anything that comes with a long-term commitment. Missing a quarter of his/her hair from dragon fire. Still pissed about it. Doesn't believe in Goliaths. He thinks those are just tall humans who work out.Protects women with vastly more valor than men, even when he risks his own life. Uses his first bonus action in combat to taunt enemies (deception roll). Bakes his own bread. Doesn't trust 'that elf' and his baked goods. Likes fishing. Can often be found sitting by a lake or a river and fishing... while drinking obviously. Doesn't like spending gold. Will always try to trade items first (I'll give you my biscuit for your ale). Thinks gems can predict the future. Emeralds are unlucky and finding them in a dungeons only means doom is ahead. Rubies mean strength and a good omen. Sapphires mean someone will need your help, and so on. Hates the sound of metal clanking as he grew up next to a blacksmith, who would at odd hours, which would keep him up at night. He sleeps with ear plugs when in the city.",,,,
"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk. Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.",,,,
"Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.",,,,
"Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don’t abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge.",,,,
"Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf’s entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf’s hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.",,,,
"Vanyar were descendants of Imin, the first Elf to awake at Cuiviénen, his wife Iminyë, and six other pairs of Elves who were awoken by them. Imin's companions, Tata and Enel, later awoke groups of nine and twelve pairs respectively, and Imin decided that since his group was the smallest and each group that he and his companions discovered was larger than the last, he then chose third rather than first in order to make up the numbers. However, only a further two groups were discovered, leaving Imin's group of fourteen by far the smallest of the three Elven clans.",,,,
"When the Elves were discovered by Oromë, each clan chose an ambassador to return with him to Valinor to verify his claims of its greatness. The Minyar (Imin's companions) sent Ingwë. Upon his return, his people were swayed by his testimony and adopted him as their king, and he led them with Oromë to Aman. Ingwë was since reckoned the High King of all Elves, and became known as Ingwë Ingweron, the ""Chief of Chieftains"", and his people were known by the rest of the Eldar as the Vanyar. In Aman the Vanyar first dwelt in Tirion. Later, they came to love the full light of the Trees and wandered into Valinor or settled on Taniquetil. Ingwë dwelt with them on the slopes of Taniquetil, beneath the halls of Manwë.[1]",,,,
"After arriving in Aman, the Vanyar were rarely seen even by other Elves. Very few individual Vanyar are named besides Imin, Ingwë, his sister (or possibly niece) Indis, and Amarië, who was in love with Finrod Felagund. Indis became the second wife of Finwë, the High King of the ?oldor and the mother of both Fingolfin and Finarfin, the latter of which founded the only house of ?oldorin Elves to sport golden Vanyarin hair.[2] After her husband was killed by Melkor in his attack on Formenos to attain the Silmarils [3], she returned to her people with her daughter Findis.",,,,
"Unlike the ?oldor, the Vanyar loved the light of Valinor so much that they never choose to return to Middle-earth, save when many of the Vanyar marched in the War of Wrath with the Host of Valinor[4]. Though they preferred the peaceful light of Valinor, the Vanyar were skilled in the arts of war and were known for their fashioning of spears, thus they no doubt fielded a formidable army in the war. Ingwë's son Ingwion led an armed host of his people from Valinor to fight in the War of Wrath. They returned to Aman, along with most of the Eldar living in the largely destroyed Beleriand, at the end of the First Age.[5]",,,,
"The Vanyar were the fairest of all the Elves, hence their name ""Fair Elves"". Unlike other kindreds attracted to the sea or the building and forging of things, the Vanyar culture seemed to revolve about the Valar and Valinor. This is probably the reason why they chose to stay in Valinor proper, centered around Taniquetil, the seat of the rulers of Arda, and loved the light of Valinor best of all the other places in Aman. They greatly valued the wisdom of the Valar and were thus favored by Manwë and Varda, and always distrusted by Melkor. They were known to have had the greatest skill in poetry of all Elves, likened to Manwë, who loved them for it. Their hair was golden, and their banners were white.",,,,
"The Teleri were sundered from the first two clans, the Vanyar and the ?oldor, because they tarried behind searching for their lost king Elwë (later known as Thingol), and the first two clans were ferried across to Valinor on a huge island before. The Maia Ossë kept them company while they waited, and became their friend. Later when Ulmo returned with the island ferry, the Teleri had grown to love the sea. Ossë convinced Ulmo to anchor the island in the Bay of Eldamar, off the shores of Aman, and persuaded many of the Teleri to remain in Middle-earth. The Teleri long remained on Tol Eressëa, and their language changed in different ways from that of the Vanyar and ?oldor. Much later the Teleri learned to build ships, and finally made it to Aman.",,,,
"The Teleri refused to join the ?oldor in leaving Valinor, and many of them were justly slain in the Kinslaying at their chief city of Alqualondë, or Swan Harbour, when they refused to supply the exiles with their swan ships, and started attacking the ?oldor. For this reason few or none of the Teleri joined the host of the Valar which set out to capture Morgoth for good. It is recounted that the Teleri eventually forgave the ?oldor for the Kinslaying, and the two kindreds were at peace again.",,,,
"Their tongue, known as Telerin or Lindalambë (tongue of the Lindar), was considered by some to be a dialect of Quenya, but the Teleri themselves considered it to be an independent language. It was much more conservative than Quenya, and was the closest to Common Telerin (from which Sindarin and Nandorin were also derived), and even to Common Eldarin of the later Elvish languages",,,,
"Elves are (generally) unusually beautiful in face and body. There is little physical difference between males and females except that which is required for reproduction.[19] They have far better vision and hearing than Men. They also have skills and abilities beyond what is possible for Men, and many can craft seemingly magical objects. In The Silmarillion, it is mentioned that the Elves are indeed closest in kin to the Ainur, given that Elves possess ethereal grace and various powers. Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink.[20] They do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire.[21] Although the Elves are more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them thus Elves do require sustenance.",,,,
"Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force; one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable.[19] Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown.",,,,
"Elves, like Men, are Children of Eru Ilúvatar and thus are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. Some Elves in the First Age living near Angband died from a wasting disease, which was presumably issuing from Thangorodrim, Morgoth's fortress. The Elves came into existence before Men, and when Elves die they pass to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.",,,,
"Tidus Stormsufer, Dragon Trainer, is in fact a strong water elf. He loves to learn all about how to act around dragons and “connect” with them. He’s a caring soul, and he is grateful for every friendly fellow being that crosses his path. He feels very close to animals, nature, and is fascinated by the mysteries of life. Will often lose his train of thought in the middle of a --- oh, look! A squirrel!",,,,
"Strengths: Wise, honorable, honest, well known and liked, idealistic, tactful, polite, patient, good listener, and a bit mysterious.",,,,
"Flaws: Thinks a lot! Often looks to books for answers instead of within. He needs his space once in a while, which sometimes comes across quite rude.",,,,
Skills: Strong ability to control water. Great with animals but especially dragons (very rare).,,,,
"Favorite things: Antiques of any kind, books, feathered pens and quality paper, dragons, and anything connected to dragons.",,,,
"Tidus Stormsurfer has known Sira Copperbranch since they started working at the School of Dragons. They both enjoy each other's company, and get along swimmingly. Although they hit it off great, a rift in their relationship formed when Sira mistakenly thought Tidus was talking about her behind her back (when he was actually talking about Zonya, the fire dragon). Ever since then, she's felt unappreciated, but in ""Rumor has it"", she found out the truth and actually kissed Tidus in return for saying how great he thought she was, including ""perfect"". Before the events of ""Rumor Has It,"" he helped the elves rescue the dragons in ""Dragons to Save, Time to be Brave.""",,,,
"Tidus currently runs the Elvendale School of Dragons, a place where dragons come to learn flying techniques and perform strength-building exercises, as seen in ""Born to do It."" Sira used to work at the Elvendale School of Dragons with him. Now that her relationship with Tidus has been mended, it has yet to be seen whether she will return to help Tidus, or devote all her attention to running The Starlight Inn.",,,,
"Tidus is thoughtful, sensitive, and helpful. He has the patience and compassion needed to be a good dragon trainer. Tidus is very knowledgeable about dragons, and his connection with them makes him a valuable elf to have around. His friends often come to him for dragon-related advice, which he is always happy to give. Tidus gives many compliments, such as commenting that Emily has nice ears, or saying that Sira is smart, funny, and brave. Some might interpret this as flirting, but maybe Tidus just sees the good in everyone around him.",,,,
"Tidus has turquoise hair that is kept neatly combed. He also has turquoise eyes, a dark complexion, and two ""Elf Tattoos"" - one, a geometric design on his cheek, and the other, a pattern of swirls on his shoulder.",,,,
"Tidus sports a navy blue tank-top with turquoise, geometric shapes on it. The sash that he wears across his shirt is light-brown, and mostly consists of thin straps. The part that covers his right shoulder is thicker, with a ""feathered"" pattern, and has a turquoise emblem on it. He also wears black pants.",,,,
"Teclis, High Loremaster of Hoeth and Warden of the White Tower, is considered by many to be one of the greatest and most powerful sorcerers this world has ever known. Teclis is the twin brother of Tyrion, the famous Elven Hero and the widely-proclaimed Defender of Ulthuan. Being of the Line of Aenarion, each of his descendants is destined for greatness amongst the Ten Kingdoms. This has made Tyrion a masterful warrior and general, and in turn, this greatness makes Teclis proficient and knowledgeable in all arts and forms of magic.[1a]",,,,
"It is said that Teclis is not a far cry to the most ancient and revered Elven mage in history; the legendary Caledor Dragontamer, whose heroic sacrifice led to the creation of a great and mighty Vortex which sucked the corrupting influence of Chaos from this world, saving it from eternal damnation. Few within the world can match Teclis and his powers over magic. No one, not even the mighty Witch King of Naggaroth, could best him in a mighty magical duel. Indeed, ever since the Battle of Finuval Plain, Teclis has cemented his place in history as Malekith's only true superior. It is even claimed that Teclis' power approaches that of the Great Necromancer, and so it is fortunate that the Loremaster has devoted his life to thwarting all malevolent powers.[1a]",,,,
"The twins differ greatly in their outlook on the world. Where Tyrion sees the protection of Ulthuan as his chief duty, Teclis seeks to safeguard the whole world and those that live in it. Such is his ideology that he came to the aid of Magnus the Pious during the Great War Against Chaos, and therefore founded the Colleges of Magic in the Empire. Since then, Teclis has walked abroad in many other lands, sharing his wisdom with those who have need of it, and wielding his magics to keep the dark forces of Chaos at bay. Thus will Teclis' legend endure long after heroes of the sword have been forgotten, for his actions shape not a battle, nor even a campaign, but the future of the world itself.[1a]",,,,
"Teclis, along with his brother Tyrion, were born as twin sons to the scholarly Prince Arathion, a distant descendant to Phoenix King Aenarion himself. Ever since Princess Alysia, the twin's mother died during childbirth, much of their lives were spent within a secluded manor within Ulthuan's remote backcountry. His father, having spent most of his life and fortune trying to repair the ancient Armor of Aenarion, did little to teach or raise the boys himself. Instead, the elderly Thornberry put it upon herself to take care of the rash and energetic Tyrion, and the frail and sickly Teclis.[5a] This all changed the day the twins came of age and were required to be presented to the current Phoenix King.[5b]",,,,
"With heavy hearts, their father, who never truly spent as much time as he would with his sons, nevertheless showed great sorrow in his eyes when he saw them go. With the aid of Lady Malene, their aunt and Korhien Ironglaive, a White Lion bodyguard, the twins were safely escorted towards the capital city of Lothern. From there, the twins began to learn their respective arts, and in a pivotal moment, the twins came face to face with N'Kari, the Slaaneshi Greater Daemon who led the Rape of Ulthuan all those years ago. Upon the great Temple of Asuryan, the twins would've met their death by the hands of this Daemon, but the God Asuryan came to their aid, banishing the daemon from the mortal plane once more. In that moment, all saw that from day on, the twins were marked by the hands of destiny",,,,
"Teclis has the attitude and insightfulness of a mage destined. Like his brother, Teclis bears the Curse of Aenarion, and this curse has made Teclis frail and sickly from the moment of his birth. Were it not for the many medical remedies and magical potions bought at great expense to keep his strength up, Teclis would've died many years ago. It was only the love and care of his brother Tyrion and the elderly Thornberry which saw Teclis pull through this rough childhood. Despite their father's overall lack of interest in the well-being of his children, it has always been known within the family that their father favours Teclis over his other son Tyrion. This is due in the most part because, like Teclis, Prince Arathion was a scholar and a mage of great skill and prestige.",,,,
"During times when his father would seclude himself in his studies, trying to repair the Armor of Aenarion, Teclis would often be there and help him despite his sickly condition. In fact, many of Prince Arathion's traits can be seen clearly upon Teclis himself.[5a] Teclis is an extremely thorough and calculating person, who values all knowledge found and puts great effort in trying to figure out its meaning, no matter how subtle or trivial it may seem to others. This has made him seek out all forms of knowledge within the world, journeying to many distant lands and braving many perils to know the true secrets of magic. He hopes that by doing so, he may one day find the ultimate knowledge on how to finally rid the world of Chaos once and for all",,,,
"Sword of Teclis - This sword was forged by Teclis, a powerful weapon to protect himself as he began the perilous quest to rescue his brother Tyrion and the Everqueen. It is charged with crackling energy that rends apart those struck by its shining blade.[1a]",,,,
"Moon Staff of Lileath - The Moon Staff is imbued with the immortal power of the goddess Lileath, eternally youthful daughter of Isha, which flows through Teclis and invigorates his feeble frame. In times of great need, Teclis can call upon the full power of the staff. Doing so allows him to unleash a fearsome barrage of magical power, or else dissipate dangerous sorcerers energies before they spiral out of control, but also leaves Teclis himself badly weakened.[1a]",,,,
"Farran is an earth elf - through and through. He is very grounded and has a strong bond with all earth and rock materials. Farran likes to see himself as the leader of the group, but he is really more a caring, nurturing type than captain material. He is very attached to his home and the plants he takes care of there. Powers: Controls earth elements like soil, plants and rocks. Strengths: He is a lot stronger – both magically and personally – than he thinks, responsible, kind, reliable, helpful, giving. Flaws: Worries too much, can’t help but collect things, doesn’t always see social patterns clearly, very cautious in potential dangerous situations, gets in fights over leadership. Skills: He has a special bond with nature (on land), can make anything grow and thrive, can magically “talk” to plants and animals, is physically strong. Favorite things: Nature, plants, animals, musical instruments, seeds, bags, tools.Farran once fell asleep watching a plant grow. When he woke up, it had grown to six times his height and lifted him to its top. He had to build a rope ladder from its vines to climb down! Farran is logical, loyal, and down-to-earth. He will sometimes burst into long motivational speeches that the others tend to ignore. A stickler for safety, Farran will pay attention to rules and details that may escape his friends' notice. Even when he doesn't have all the answers, Farran will try to act like he knows what he's doing, so that the others will look up to him for leadership. In ""Unite the Magic"", and ""The Dragon Whisperer"", he is shown to have a large appetite. He especially likes to eat delicious pastry foods made by Johnny Baker.Farran has dark-brown hair that is slightly tousled. He also has light-green eyes, a fair complexion, and two ""Elf Tattoos"" - one, a green zigzag on his cheek, and the other, the earth insignia (a leaf with three points) on his shoulder.",,,,
"War Crown of Saphery - The War Crown is an ancient symbol of the magical realms of Saphery, seldom seen outside the walls of the White Tower except in times of peril. It was gifted to Teclis by the former High Loremaster on the eve of the young mage's departure on his quest for his brother, Tyrion.[1a]",,,,
"Potions of Inner Strength - Since his sickly childhood, Teclis has carried supplies of these revitalizing tonics wherever he goes. Both sparkle in the light as if the Loremaster had captured stars to brew his potion, but while Sariour is a golden, sunlike yellow, Charoi is the deepest blue of night.[3f]",,,,
"Noctura was banished to the Shadow World by her closest friend, Lumia, and can now only speak through the waters of Shadow Fountain to Ragana. Supposedly, Lumia created the Shadow World as a ""gift"" for Noctura, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. Noctura has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. ""The Legend of Noctura"" is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as Noctura prepares to put her schemes into motion, Elvendale will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real. Noctura is a vindictive villain who delights in wreaking havoc. For the last thousand years, she has been plotting her revenge, and is finally ready to take action. Her fiendish plans for Elvendale are to drain the world of its magic. This diabolical elf is determined to get her revenge, and claims that ""death is coming on swift black wings."" Noctura has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead. Her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal.

"Naida the water elf is an adventurer at heart. She is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Izdur Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group.Naida has aqua hair that fades to dark-blue at the ends, which she leaves long and flowing.  A braid goes across the top of her head, as a headband would.  She also has aqua eyes, a light complexion, and one facial tattoo – a white, water-themed mark on her cheek.  On her shoulder is the water insignia (a crescent-shaped wave). She also wears a swirling blue crown on her forehead. Powers: Controls bodies of water: the sea, lakes and waterfalls. Strengths: Confident, helpful, nurturing and wise. Flaws: Daydreamer, a bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times. Skills: She controls water and has a special relationship with all water animals; she is quite powerful for her age. She can make others feel special. Favorite things: Adventures, maps, friendship, animals and board games, sailing and spending time in the spa.",,,,
"Naida lives by the water in her houseboat, and sometimes she stays in an old beautiful spa, where her friend Delphia the dolphin lives. Naida might be a little more reserved than her friends, but when encouraged to, she will let loose and join in the fun. She seems to have stage fright, feeling uncomfortable with dancing in front of her friends, or talking in front of a camera. Naida doesn't seem to have as much thirst for adventure as her friends, avoiding scary situations that can potentially lead to danger (such as exploring a cave.) Although she might prefer to spend time at her relaxing and peaceful spa, Naida would never let a little thing like fear stop her, and won't hesitate to go on a mission.",,,,
"faerie, also spelled faerie or faery, a mythical being of folklore and romance usually having magic powers and dwelling on earth in close relationship with humans. It can appear as a dwarf creature typically having green clothes and hair, living underground or in stone heaps, and characteristically exercising magic powers to benevolent ends; as a diminutive sprite commonly in the shape of a delicate, beautiful, ageless winged woman dressed in diaphanous white clothing, inhabiting faerieland, but making usually well-intentioned intervention in personal human affairs; or as a tiny, mischievous, and protective creature generally associated with a household hearth.",,,,
"faeries are usually conceived as being characteristically beautiful or handsome and as having lives corresponding to those of human beings, though longer. They have no souls and at death simply perish. They often carry off children, leaving changeling substitutes, and they also carry off adults to faerieland, which resembles pre-Christian abodes of the dead. People transported to faerieland cannot return if they eat or drink there. faerie and human lovers may marry, though only with restrictions whose violation ends the marriage and, often, the life of the human. Some female faeries are deadly to human lovers. faeries are said to be of human size or smaller, down to a height of 3 inches (7.5 cm) or less. Female faeries may tell fortunes, particularly prophesying at births and foretelling deaths. Several herbs, especially St.-John’s-wort and yarrow, are potent against faeries, and hawthorn trees, foxglove, and groundsel are so dear to them that abuse of these plants may bring retribution.",,,,
"faeries, just like any fantastical creature born in the imaginations of men and women, can be whatever we wish them to be, take on whatever form we fancy, speak and do the things the writers of their stories make them speak and do. It’s hard to pin down characteristics of a group of creatures who have been seen in so many different lights.",,,,
"Freckles are really just the kisses of faeries.faeries live where there is the least chance of human contact – in forests, up trees, in hollow places, on mountainsides, and even – in some stories – in invisible realms right among humankind. faeries love honey cake, milk, nectar, and sweet butter. faeries watch over and protect the natural world – woodlands, trees, rivers and growing things. Many faeries like to play practical (and sometimes not-so-practical) jokes on humans and even each other. Iron negates a faeries’ magical powers and causes them pain. A sudden chill breeze, or ripples across the surface of water, are often indications that a faerie is nearby. faeries can live to be hundreds of years old. faeries are magical by nature. faeries love to dance.  Many legends claim faeries are prone to kidnapping human babies, leaving a changeling in its place. The oldest and strongest faeries are fallen angels. Some faeries were once humans who simply got lost in faerieland. faeries are quick to do you a favor … and even quicker to demand payment for it.",,,,
"A faerie is a magical creature who resembles a human. Beyond that, defining faeries is almost impossible. Their legend is as old as European civilization itself, and they come in all colors, sizes, and temperaments. No two faerie encounters are quite the same!",,,,
"The fey people are as diverse in personality as they are in appearance. Their most common traits are a quick wit, a love of parties. Beyond this, they come in all habits and tempers.",,,,
"Some faeries are helpful. They guide travelers who are lost in the forest back towards home. They help with household chores, often going to work overnight, so that their hosts wake up to a happy surprise. If they are particularly fond of you, they might even lead you to treasure, give you magical gifts, help you win your true love’s hand in marriage, or cast a lucky charm over your life.",,,,
"Others are mischievous. They delight in misleading travelers or luring them into exhausting dances that go one for days. They also like to taunt domestic animals, pinching horses to make them gallop, stealing milk from cows, and playing cat-and-mouse with cats.",,,,
"And then there are some faeries who are dangerous—so dangerous that, for centuries, they were called “the good folk,” “the little people,” or “the neighbors” because people were too afraid of them to say their name aloud. These faeries usually live in hierarchies, where the king or queen is the most dangerous of all. They don’t just get travelers lost; they lead them into deadly bogs. When they take a liking to a human baby, they don’t cast a charm over its life. They steal it from its cradle and replace it with a sickly “changeling.” And if they ever share their dances or treasure with you, be sure that the gift comes with a curse. The most dangerous faeries can declare ware over small disputes. Fortunately, they are more likely to go to war with other magical creatures, like pixies or trolls.",,,,
"It’s important to be aware that most faeries have fluid personalities. They can go from helpful to mischievous quickly, and despite their cleverness, they don’t have to have a reason for their decisions!",,,,
"As magical creatures, faeries have almost unlimited power. They can fly. They can make flowers bloom. They can conjure up gold. They can glow in the dark. They can create and cast new charms for any situation, and their curses can last for hundreds of years.",,,,
"Fortunately, there are some measures you can take to keep faeries at bay. Marigolds, primroses, rowan wood, four-leaf clovers, and St. John’s wort can all be worn or hung over doors to repel the good folk. Iron is even more powerful. An iron nail in your pocket or a horseshoe over your door will provide long-lasting safety.",,,,
"If you’re hoping to gain a faerie as a friend, leave a saucer of milk, cream, butter, or ale for the fey people to enjoy at night. If you do this on a regular basis, you might be rewarded!",,,,

"Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality they are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal.",,,,
"Faeries are extremely attractive to humans as well as to vampires. Vampires have a hard time resisting faeries because of their smell and taste; faerie blood is intoxicating to vampires. This makes face to face interactions between them all but impossible. When a faerie dies a corpse is not left, just a sparkling powder (or faerie dust); the body just disintegrates. Faeries are secretive about their own race, customs, interactions, and world. They normally inhabit the fae world, named Faerie, but there are portals and doorways between it and the human world. Those who have faerie blood in them but are not full-blooded faeries have limited fae powers, while maintaining some of the attractive qualities of faeries.",,,,
"As with many other supernatural creatures, faeries have weaknesses that can be used to defeat them. However, none of these methods were proven to be able to completely kill them; the only way to stop them is banishing them to their realm through a spell. However the above isn't completely true: if a faerie is exposed to a very strong electromagnetic field for enough time they will lose control of themselves and explode, as Dean was able to kill one by trapping the faerie into a microwave oven, however as the faerie in question was very weak, its unknown what affect it would have on a more powerful faerie.",,,,

Faeries are known for holding a Faerie Festival each year on the 20th day of the Month of Gathering to create a sense of unity among all faeries. Each year, the festival is held in a new place depending on who the hostess is.",,,,
"The most common faeries are associated with one of the six elements. The elemental faeries can control the forces of earth, air, water, light, fire and darkness.",,,,
"Due to the legend of their origins, the faeries are associated with the beauty of angels and the viciousness and malevolence of demons. Like angels, they are the least understood of all magical people—the great ancient mystery in the Shadow World. Although they are widely believed to be hybrid descendants of demons and angels—something that their kind has seemingly not bothered to deny—faeries possess human souls just as other Downworlders do, and they are counted as members of the human race by the denizens of Heaven.[1]",,,,
"The Fair Folk are known for their unearthly beauty, many faeries said to be extremely attractive with delicate and regal faces. Though they mostly resemble human beings, some have extraordinary features such as wings, horns, oddly colored-eyes or skin,[2] much like the marks of warlocks. A common aspect among them is their pointed ears. Faeries commonly incorporate flora and multiple forms of vegetation as part of their ensemble.",,,,
"The gentry subdivision faeries are the knights, kings and queens, and court members; they are close to the monarchs and considered a part of the central Court society—gentry faeries are the ones that look human. The common folk are the other kinds of faeries, generally looking less like humans, such as nixies, pixies or piskies, brownies, selkies, satyrs, mermaids, kelpies, hobgoblins, and boggarts.[3][4][5]",,,,
"As time typically flows differently for them and in their realm, they are very long-lived and become only more artful and powerful as they age, though they are not immortal.",,,,
"They are known for their cunning and their cruel sense of humor, and they especially delight in tricking humans—both mundanes and Shadowhunters alike. They frequently seek to bargain with humans, offering someone their heart's desire but failing to mention that the desire comes with a terrible cost. They are committed to notions of honor and etiquette, and while faeries always exactly follow the letter of any promise they have made, they deliver these results with great irony and often use clever wordplay to their advantage in order to create loopholes.",,,,
"The Fair Folk are also unable to lie. They might, however, tell what they believe is true, even if it is not. They may also expertly weave lies into sentences by using methods such as not telling the whole truth, letting others assume things, or not correcting the people with whom they're speaking; this does not, however, apply to half-fey, who can lie as easily as any other being.[6] Faeries are also capable of manipulating one another.[7][8] There have apparently been times when these either playful or serious manipulations, specifically resulting from problems or conflicts between rival courts, bleed into the world.[7]",,,,
"The origin of faeries vary according to legends and is not wholly known. According to one, faeries are fallen angels, cast down out of Heaven for their pride.[12] Another states that faeries are born of the union of demons and angels, both of whom were present on Earth in the early beginnings of the planet's history. However, most known faeries nowadays are in fact the offspring of other faeries (just as most Shadowhunters are the offspring of other Shadowhunters and not born from the Mortal Cup), so how faeries were originally created is actually unknown.[13]",,,,
"Faeries are capable of bearing children. However, they apparently do not reproduce often as it is very hard for them to get pregnant.[14][10]",,,,
"A union between human and fey will result in a human offspring that may retain some faerie-like aspects or have a penchant for certain kinds of fey magic.[7] Additionally, the children of faeries and Shadowhunters will be Shadowhunters, though they, too, will often have some faerie-like physical attributes, such as pointed ears.",,,,
"While most half-faeries would be primarily human, those who reside among faeries or in the Courts would have or develop stronger faerie qualities,[15] much like with changelings. Half-faeries tend to be affected less by faerie weaknesses: half-faeries are able to lie, and they are not typically hurt by things like rowan wood and pure iron outside of some minor irritation,[9] nor will their true faerie names hold any real power over them.[16][17]",,,,
"Because of their isolation and extensive interbreeding, faeries risk the weakening of their family lines. For this reason, faeries sometimes lure humans into their world, typically by enticing adult humans into their revels or tricking them with faerie food. They would trap them with their faerie magic in their realm until they forget their former lives and ""go native,"" or at least until they can be used to produce new faerie children.[7]",,,,
"Another way to strengthen their bloodlines is by creating changelings—mundane children taken from their homes and replaced with a sickly faerie child. Changeling children they bring in mysteriously take on fey attributes and are able to perform some faerie magic, thus bringing fresh strong blood into the faerie lines. Meanwhile, the fey child left with the mundanes may continue to live on with the belief that they are mundanes, unaware of their true origin.",,,,
"Taking in changelings is apparently a practice preferred over kidnapping adult humans, and thus the Nephilim do not interfere with this.[7]",,,,

" faeries have the ability to project and control light and nature. faeries and witches are the only species shown to possess this power. A Fae with this ability can channel nature through their body and project it in a concentrated and powerful blast of light which seems to manifest as kinetic force, conclusively throwing or repelling objects a considerable distance. Most faeries use this ability to attack an enemy. They can even turn the energy into an explosive ball that they can throw at their enemies, somewhat like a grenade. The light varies in color, from blue to golden, usually depending on the time of day; blue seems to be more common at night whereas gold appears in daylight. The ability has been described as ""nature itself"". Photokinesis is the central feature of the magic of some species of faeries and can be used for a variety of purposes beyond offensive explosions. faeries can use their light abilities to sense things about other faeries and apparently render beings unconscious and bring a person back to consciousness. faeries can make humans do their bidding. The faerie only needs to have eye contact in order to seize your mind with a simple phrase or change in tone of voice.- faeries can manipulate vegetation. faeries can grow plants to enormous proportions in nearly any environment, and use them as weapons that can grab and attack with vines and roots, grow or retract thorns.",,,,
"Leprechauns have been shown to make deals, like crossroads demons, to cast spells. It appears as though Faeries are capable of creating alternate ""pocket"" dimensions, as seen by the plane of Faerie and the extra-dimensional nature of Hot Wings. It can be assumed that only particularly powerful fae or a number of them working in concert can create another dimension. Faeries can transport themselves and others to other dimensional planes. Mortals and faeries of lesser power require fixed portals to do so, but more powerful faeries may cross dimensions at will. Powerful faeries can banish people to other dimensions against their will, though less powerful faeries appear to require consent. Magic - faeries are incredibly powerful magical beings, being apparently ""all about energy."" Shapeshifting - faeries can disguise themselves as beautiful humans. While the true form of a faerie is goblin-like with pale gray skin, pointed ears, long nose, blue-green eyes, long sharp claws and rodent fangs, faeries can disguise themselves as beautiful and attractive humanoids. Though they have a certain degree of control over this ability, by default they attune themselves to whatever the ideal of beauty is on the frequency of the dominant species of a particular dimension (that is, they appear as classically attractive humans while on earth). They can also change shape from being human-sized to being as tiny as a tennis ball which glows of bright light, or more like larger fireflies. A faerie's true form can be a variety of things. They can be beautiful flower faries to dryads who are the souls of trees.",,,,
"It has also been shown that powerful faeries can break and reverse some weak magic spells cast by others.They are shown to be able to enter peoples dreams and converse with that person when faeries both entered their slumber. For a vampire, drinking large amounts of faerie blood might trigger oneirokinesis. faerie hybrids seem to receive dreams while they are in a coma.  Able to cast vivid and convincing illusions in order to trick others, as demonstrated with the illusion on the fae world, making it appear more appealing and beautiful. This ability is very similar to their shapeshifting ability if not the same. ""Super Nova"" - A power unique certain bloodline of Faeries, this enables a faerie to channel their light into a ""super nova"" like ball of energy. Upon explosion the energy will kill any vampire within range. Telepathy - faeries have the ability to read each others' minds and can read other peoples' minds as well. Faeries are able to read the thoughts of any sentient creature that gives off brain waves (which means it excludes vampires). They can receive images or sentences, depending on the person. If they concentrate, they can ""turn off"" this ability. If they focus hard enough, they can ""enter"" another person's mind and ""reset"" memories that have been tampered with, such as through mind control.",,,,
"Invisibility - They can only be seen if they want to be or by people who have traveled to their realm and returned. This ability continues to work, even after the faerie in question's death, meaning humans who haven't been to the faerie realm can't see their remains. Telekinesis - Some faeries, such as leprechauns, can move objects with their minds. Healing - faeries have the ability to cure broken or withered plants; wounds, broken bones, low vitality, and even diseases and restore the emotions and spirits of others.",,,,
" faeries can tap into the power of the past by connecting with the energy that exists in the universe. Through a connection to an object they can then enter the minds of those who were present in these areas. Flight - Tinks and dark faes can fly. faeries are much older and wiser than humans and even other supernatural creatures like vampires, werewolves, and witches. faeries can take far more trauma than humans can without much discomfort or injury. The strength of a faerie depends on the type of faerie. Leprechauns can launch humans across rooms with their bare hands easily, tinks can knock humans around by ramming into them, and redcaps and the Wicked Witch can throw humans around. faeries are much stronger than any human. They're strong enough to toss a fully grown human across a room with great force possibly killing the human.",,,,
"Oath - When Faeries make an oath or promise the faerie and other person must touch fingers and a photokinetic light will come through the promiser's arm. If the oath is broken, great dishonor is brought upon the faerie and their clan and is thus considered an act of war. Faeries also make pacts signing the contract with their blood. This is called ""blood on vellum."" This is said to be the most sacred of contracts. Some faeries, such as leprechauns, can teleport from any location to another in the blink of an eye. Good faeries can take people with them. It is not known whether or not that he teleports to a different dimension for a short period of time and teleports back to the location that he desires.",,,,
"Powerful faeries, such as Gilda, and leprechauns can manipulate reality, doing things such as manipulating space to imprison a person or making a person mimic death, with no actual stimulus. The faerie being known as the Wicked Witch was able to transform three freedom fighters into a tin man, a scarecrow, and a cowardly lion. Also, Gilda was able to transform a fake-sword into a real sword and two guns into feathers.Some Faeries possess the ability to decode and translate elaborate ciphers in an ancient form of fae script. This may be a photokinetic technique rather than a separate ability, as Fae refers to it as a ""lost art"".

Also, Gilda was able to transform a fake-sword into a real sword and two guns into feathers.",,,,
"Faeries, like vampires and werewolves, possess the unnatural abilities of swiftness, grace, and heightened senses of smell and hearing. The Faerie armies are also legendary in terms of their might in war, as evidenced by their role in the Dark War. The magic of the fey is believed to be unique in the world. It is very old and powerful, but neither demonically nor seraphically aligned. They can harness the powers of the ley lines, along with other strange magics. The Faeries are older than the Accords, older than the Nephilim, and are said to even be the oldest among all races of Downworlders. They possess their own magic that the Gray Book can only partly and imperfectly protect against, at best; however, there does exist Nephilim Marks that protect Shadowhunters from faerie glamours for this very reason.",,,,
"Faeries have long life spans—longer than other mortals—and have the ability to choose when they die. Based on the deaths of Auraline and Nerissa, it seems the fey often make this choice after having lost their love, no longer wishing to live without them. Some faeries have the ability to send someone pleasant dreams; it is considered a faerie gift. Clad in the silver robes that denote her station, an elf closes her eyes to shut out the distractions of the battlefield and begins her quiet chant. Fingers weaving in front of her, she completes her spell and launches a tiny bead of fire toward the enemy ranks, where it erupts into a conflagration that engulfs the soldiers. ",,,,
"Checking and rechecking his work, a human scribes an intricate magic circle in chalk on the bare stone floor, then sprinkles powdered iron along every line and graceful curve. When the circle is complete, he drones a long incantation. A hole opens in space inside the circle, bringing a whiff of brimstone from the otherworldly plane beyond.Crouching on the floor in a dungeon intersection, a gnome tosses a handful of small bones inscribed with mystic symbols, muttering a few words of power over them. Closing his eyes to see the visions more clearly, he nods slowly, then opens his eyes and points down the passage to his left.",,,,
"Wizards are supreme magic-users, defined and united as a class by the spells they cast. Drawing on the subtle weave of magic that permeates the cosmos, wizards cast spells of explosive fire, arcing lightning, subtle deception, and brute-force mind control. Their magic conjures monsters from other planes of existence, glimpses the future, or turns slain foes into zombies. Their mightiest spells change one substance into another, call meteors down from the sky, or open portals to other worlds.",,,,
"Wild and enigmatic, varied in form and function, the power of magic draws students who seek to master its mysteries. Some aspire to become like the gods, shaping reality itself. Though the casting of a typical spell requires merely the utterance of a few strange words, fleeting gestures, and sometimes a pinch or clump of exotic materials, these surface components barely hint at the expertise attained after years of apprenticeship and countless hours of study.",,,,
"Wizards live and die by their spells. Everything else is secondary. They learn new spells as they experiment and grow in experience. They can also learn them from other wizards, from ancient tomes or inscriptions, and from ancient creatures (such as the fey) that are steeped in magic.",,,,
"As a student of arcane magic, you have a spellbook containing spells that show the first glimmerings of your true power. See Spells Rules for the general rules of spellcasting and the Spells Listing for the wizard spell list.",,,,
"For example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.",,,,
"You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.You can use an arcane focus (see the Adventuring Gear section) as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells. Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar).",,,,
"A loyal leader, this wizard strives to both protect and push his friends to stand up and fight for what they believe in. He has little patience for those who fail to use logic or common sense (ahem, Pippin) and doesn’t hesitate to speak his mind if he feels it necessary. While he is often open to attending celebrations, he finds himself on the sidelines observing (or lighting fireworks), letting the others entertain through song and dance. He is a powerful orator when necessary, yet he truly shines when providing his wisdom through individual conversations with his companions during particularly trying times. His Intuitive personality is likely, at least partially, a result of Gandalf being an immortal wizard. This trait, combined with the Thinking trait, results in a keen ability to strategize and piece together seemingly unrelated pieces of information into a cohesive plan.",,,,
"Merlin is a powerful wizard and central character in Disney's The Sword in the Stone. Merlin is the wizard master and friend of young 12-year-old orphan Arthur, a.k.a. the Wart. Merlin is also the magical rival of Madam Mim. Merlin also has a pet owl named Archimedes. He is also voiced by Karl Swenson in the film, Hamilton Camp in the House of Mouse, and currently by Jeff Bennett. Merlin is a wizard of unspecified origin, who originally lived in a forest cottage. He is a very wise character who believes in the philosophy of ""Brain over Brawn"". To this end, Merlin values education as opposed to the war-training of the rest of society. Despite his wisdom, he can be absentminded and forgetful, as well as clumsy. As a wizard, Merlin shows a wide variety of powers, and is widely hailed as being the most powerful wizard in the world. He shows an ability to see into the future, though not exactly. He can enchant both objects and people, and possesses a well-developed ability to shapeshift. He can also travel through time, which has granted him much knowledge about society. He often references his knowledge of the future when speaking to others, leaving them confused. Merlin is first seen getting water from his well and preparing afternoon tea in his cottage, having predicted that a young boy will soon join them. He admits that the specific identity is unknown. He later meets a pre-teen orphan called Arthur, commonly known as the Wart, after the boy literally drops through the roof. Merlin speaks to the Wart about the value of an education and decides to appoint himself as the Wart's tutor. After Wart explains that he must return to his castle, Merlin decides to accompany him, and displays his magical abilities by shrinking all his possessions so that they fit into a small carpet bag. They arrive at the castle of the Wart's foster father Sir Ector. Though Sir Ector initially disapproves, Merlin is able to persuade him though a display of magic, which frightens the man into accepting Merlin's offer. Merlin, who is confusedly called ""Marvin"" by Ector, is provided the ""guest room"", which is apparently a crumbling, teetering tower. The next day, Merlin begins the Wart's education, teaching him the principle of brain over brawn by transforming the Wart into a fish. During the adventure Merlin, also in fish form, is trapped in an old helmet, while the Wart is chased by a giant pike. Merlin forgets the magic words to change them both back, but remembers just in time.Later, Merlin goes to retrieve the Wart for another lesson, but the Wart is being forced to clean as punishment for being late as a result of the previous lesson. Merlin uses his magic to enchant the various kitchen objects into cleaning themselves, and sneaks the Wart out. Merlin transforms himself and the Wart into squirrels, where they live the dangerous life of the creatures. Merlin and the Wart are both pursued as mates by 2 female squirrels. Merlin grows increasingly annoyed and finally transforms into a human out of anger. He then transforms the Wart, much to the sorrow of the young female squirrel who had been chasing the boy.",,,,
"Barbarians come in a lot of different shapes and sizes, but most tend to be taller and more muscular than other classes. They have faces that let them look intense and animalistic. They have powerful builds, so they’re able to use heavy weapons and carry lots of equipment. Their arms tend to be long, and they have rough skin. Coming up with a good physical description for your barbarian character is important because it can help you to think about how your character’s appearance will affect their behavior and outlook on life.",,,,
" Barbarians have long, messy hair. They sometimes have beards. They are also some of the few characters who are allowed to wear their hair long. there is no cultural norm for hair color, but most barbarians have dark hair or hair that is dark at the roots and light at the ends. While there’s no cultural norm for eye color, most barbarians have dark eyes. Barbarians have tough, thick skin and are sometimes covered in scars. They often have a healthy tan. Barbarians have unkempt hair and rough facial features. Generally, they have a low brow, prominent nose, and thin lips. Shaggy hair and unkempt beards are common. Scars: Barbarians are in a constant state of physical conflict, so it’s common for them to have obvious signs of past wounds. Barbarians also sometimes use scars and battle marks as tattoos, so if you have the option, you might want to avoid using the deformity rules. Clothing: Barbarians wear clothes that are rough and rugged. While many stereotypes depict barbarians as wearing nothing but a loincloth, but this is rarely true. Barbarians come from the wilds – outside society – but this doesn’t mean that they don’t have their own sense of class and style. Some barbarian cultures favor colorful clothing and ornate jewelry.",,,,
"In the past, most barbarians lived in tribes. These tribes were nomadic, so they constantly traveled from place to place. They followed the animals that they hunted and maintained close relationships with the gods. They built up large camps that were made out of simple shelters and animal hides. Each tribe had a strong sense of community and family.",,,,
"Over time, as civilization encroached, the tribes gradually merged with it. If the tribe was strong, it was often absorbed into the new culture. Sometimes the tribe was allowed to maintain its culture as a special group within the civilization. Most of the time, however, they were driven out to the fringes of civilization or the wilderness.",,,,
"After surviving for so long as a separate and unique culture, the barbarians still look at themselves as different and superior to others. They have a strong sense of honor, and they are fiercely loyal to their friends. Barbarians are generally at peace with most races. They get along well with most groups with traditional warrior cultures. Barbarians generally hate those who they think have abandoned the warrior lifestyle and turned into cowards.",,,,
"Barbarians have a strong sense of community and honor. They are proud and believe in living as close to nature as possible. Barbarians are also traditionalists.

They consider their actions to be the result of the decisions that they make, and they would never seek to blame others for their decisions. Barbarians are generally at peace with most species and cultures. They tend to get along with those who have warrior traditions. They are also closely tied to the natural world, so they are usually in harmony with nature. It is unusual for a barbarian to worship a god. Barbarians generally find it more natural to worship a pantheon of gods or nature. Many barbarians believe that they are a living incarnation of a god. Although barbarians have no formal religion, they have a strong sense of honor and loyalty. They try to emulate their gods by living in harmony with nature and fulfilling their duties. Barbarians are usually adventurers just because they don’t really know what else to do. They have an inherent wanderlust and a desire to stand out. They have a strong sense of honor, so they often look for opportunities to prove themselves. They are natural leaders, so they often rise to leadership positions in groups.",,,,

"A tall human tribesman strides through a blizzard, draped in fur and hefting his axe. He laughs as he charges toward the frost giant who dared poach his people’s elk herd. A half-orc snarls at the latest challenger to her authority over their savage tribe, ready to break his neck with her bare hands as she did to the last six rivals. Frothing at the mouth, a dwarf slams his helmet into the face of his drow foe, then turns to drive his armored elbow into the gut of another. These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea. For some, their rage springs from a communion with fierce animal spirits. Others draw from a roiling reservoir of anger at a world full of pain. For every barbarian, rage is a power that fuels not just a battle frenzy but also uncanny reflexes, resilience, and feats of strength. Not every member of the tribes deemed “barbarians” by scions of civilized society has the barbarian class. A true barbarian among these people is as uncommon as a skilled fighter in a town, and he or she plays a similar role as a protector of the people and a leader in times of war. Life in the wild places of the world is fraught with peril: rival tribes, deadly weather, and terrifying monsters. Barbarians charge headlong into that danger so that their people don’t have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes barbarians perfectly suited for adventuring. Wandering is often a way of life for their native tribes, and the rootless life of the adventurer is little hardship for a barbarian. Some barbarians miss the close-knit family structures of the tribe, but eventually find them replaced by the bonds formed among the members of their adventuring parties.",,,,
"Brutal Critical: This feature has several problems. The intent is to make critical hits the Barbarian’s source of additional damage at high levels where fighters get a third attack and paladins get Improved Divine Smite. Unfortunately, the math just doesn’t work out. Reckless Attack allows you score a critical hit roughly 9.75% of the time, which is more than average but not so often that they’re consistent. Brutal Critical also mandates that you use a greataxe to maximize the benefits, which discourages you from using weapons like a greatsword or a maul. Even then, each Brutal Critical die adds just 1.2 damage per round on average with a greataxe (assuming 2 attacks and Reckless Attack). You need all three of those dice to match Improved Divine Smite, and you don’t get the third die until level 17. Saves: Strength saves are fairly rare, but Constitution saves are common and typically very problematic. Proficiencies: Medium armor and martial weapons will get you a long way, but you get no tool proficiencies, and only two skills. Rage: Rage is the Barbarian’s defining class feature. The bonus damage isn’t huge, but it’s reliable and consistent. The resistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage multiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but your number of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid it. Unarmored Defense: This is great flavor for the Barbarian, but won’t do much good for you unless your abilities are very high. Your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers need to total +7 to match the total AC bonus provided by half plate armor. That’s generally achievable by level 8 unless you rolled for ability scores, and assuming that you started with 14 Dexterity and largely ignored Strength. More realistically, you should expect to hit 20 Constitution by 12th level, and even then Unarmored Defense will only break even with Half plate. If magic armor is an option you’ll need to put an ability increase into Dexterity before you have a good reason to drop your armor.",,,,
"Primal Knowledge (Addition): The Barbarian is notoriously useless outside of combat because their class features are almost exclusively dedicated to acts of violence. The one tiny sliver of non-combat functionality which they get is their skills, and while they get the standard 2 class skills their skill options are often only situationally useful so most barbarians are locked into Athletics and Perception because those are the only consistently useful choices. Adding 2 more skill proficiencies does a lot to improve the Barbarian’s non-combat capabilities, and granting them past level 1 means that the barbarian can grow and develop as a character, learning new skills in addition to new and exciting ways to hurt stuff.",,,,
"Barbarians are all about getting angry and dealing damage. They have a ton of hit points, resistance to damage, and Rage gives a wonderful bonus to damage. Barbarians don’t get much in the way of skills, so generally they’re stuck as combat monsters, but they function equally well as a Defender and a Striker, and certain character options can even expand them into a limited Support role.The pronounced muscles of his broad shoulders and back ripple with the simple action of brushing a whetstone along the blade of his greataxe.

Still, she was able to learn much about the world. She grew up a fighter, always proving her own toughness. She learned how to read and write along the way, but she was never really interested in it. It was really just a means to communicate with others. While working as a barmaid, Hilda was impressed by the gold and gems that the lord of the castle wore around his neck and on his fingers.

"Lothar also has a fear of large creatures, like trolls and giants, and he has a crippling fear of bees. This came about because of his childhood, where a giant and a bee attacked him when he was a young boy. He knows this fear isn’t rational, but he can’t help it. If he sees a bee, he will go into a barbarian rage, attacking the bee and anyone who gets in his way. He will stop when the bee is dead or he is dead.

He’s not a very handsome man, but he moves with great, athletic strength. When in battle, he usually wears next to nothing, save for a metal breast-plate taken from a slain berserker. He carries a war hammer, which he forged himself from the metal of a fallen statue. He keeps his hair greasy so opponents can’t get a good grip on him.",,,,
"Lothar has a scar running along the left side of his face, from his forehead down to his chin. He got this from a duel with a baby dragon that got out of hand, as his previous battle scars testify. His left ear is also slightly deformed, but he wears an earring in it. Lothar speaks with a thick accent and swears a lot. He’s a loud, boisterous man who laughs and tells stories constantly. He acts like a berserker who fights for the fun of it. Overall, his appearance tends to scare people away, and he’s fine with that.",,,,
"Lothar likes his life of adventure, traveling the countryside, earning gold, and drinking. He has no interest in settling down, but he’s always open to hearing about it. He is traveling the Kingdom of Grabisco, trying to make his fortune fighting the orcs and goblins. He’s been looking for a unique magic item that many say don’t exist – a lute of persuasion.

"From the shattered lands of the South this proud race of people hails. A tribal and nomadic culture, the southern Barbarians prayed to no deity and swore allegiance to no leader. This was the reason that when the kingdoms of the East invaded the Barbarian lands, little resistance was found. The scattered villages fought valiantly, each man, woman and child battling to the death against the hordes of magic users from the distant lands, but to no avail. The lands of the Barbarians, beautiful forests and the majestic jungles, were conquered by the East, and the tribes scattered to the four winds. Still proud, the tribes still gather occasionally, but they are small in number. They despised all magic, for it was this mystical force that was used against them in the wars they had fought. Their battles in the war taught them much about magic however. Because of the war against the mages, all Barbarians have a certain immunity to magic bound within them as a result of so much exposure to the powerful forces. Training in brute strength and physical force was the norm for Barbarians, with great endurance and vitality being praised. They came to be large people, with flaring tempers which makes the blood of a Barbarian truly boil when he is outraged. Chief weapon to the Barbarians was the Axe, for it was this weapon that proved most useful to them in the forests and jungles where they resided. Their great strength allows them to wield other weapons in a single hand, but the axe is still the weapon of choice for most Barbarians.",,,,
"People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one’s own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature—keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise. Barbarians are mighty warriors who relied on their strength and incredible toughness, characterized by a bestial rage empowered either by ancestral totems and nature spirits or an inner passion for violence. Barbarians were less versatile than fighters but were tougher and capable of dealing heavy damage to their foes much more quickly.",,,,
"The extended periods of time that most Barbarians spend away from their homes and civilization requires that they learn to repair their own weapons and armor, although their skill is no match for the talent of a true blacksmith. A barbarian's true strength lies not in the body, but in the spirit... A nomadic wanderer, the Barbarian combines brawn and ruggedness with a mastery of weapons, using devastating melee attacks along with war cries to boost his allies—or demoralize his enemies. Glorified by many a song and fireside tale, the Barbarian is unrivaled in delivering unrelenting melee fury on anyone foolish enough to greet their axe-head.",,,,
"For ages, the Barbarians were shaped to be as strong and unyielding as stone. Immense in size and unmatched in ferocity, they were charged from birth with a duty passed through generations: to protect the world. They became aimless, haunted by their past, traveling from place to place without honor or direction. The Barbarian has unparalleled strength and expertly wields an entire arsenal in battle, with a weapon for every occasion. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shaking slams to send approaching hordes reeling. A brutal, physical warrior, the Barbarian roams around the battlefield constantly, dishing heavy damage and wielding an array of powerful weapons with ease. Wild and bloodthirsty berserkers lurk on the fringes of civilisation, ever pressing in through feral forays to snatch what they can before vanishing back whence they came.

"Elves can live well over 700 years, giving them a broad perspective on events that might trouble the shorter-lived races more deeply. They are more often amused than excited, and more likely to be curious than greedy. They tend to remain aloof and unfazed by petty happenstance. When pursuing a goal, however, whether adventuring on a mission or learning a new skill or art, elves can be focused and relentless. They are slow to make friends and enemies, and even slower to forget them. They reply to petty insults with disdain and to serious insults with vengeance.",,,,

They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so.

Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators.

Garan elves were also very deadly warriors, fighting solely with their own bodies and relying on their own speed, agility, and martial arts. Weapons were forbidden in their culture, and an elf who used them would be executed.

Unlike any other known race of elves, those of Lorwyn have relatively short life spans of about 30 to 40 years.",,,,
"The elves of Lorwyn often hunt eyeblights, creatures who fail the elves' exacting standards of beauty and therefore have the lowest status in their eyes.

For this, the elves can animate a parasitic plant called nettlevines to bind around their victims, creating twisted, but powerful and eminently controllable minions.",,,,

"Dwarves are unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, are resistant to virtually all poisons and it takes less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also have dense bodies and are difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads, that other races might find hindering, with little ill effect.",,,,
"Male dwarves are often bald and grow thick facial hair, which is sometimes used to display social status. Unusually for humanoids, both sexes naturally grow ample facial hair, though the majority of shield dwarf females shave their beards off.",,,,
"Many dwarves have an affinity for the caverns in which they live, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could almost seem supernatural at times. They are also renowned for their metalworking and crafting abilities.",,,,
"Duergars, also known as gray dwarves, are a subterranean subrace of dwarves.They carve out an existence in the Underdark. Their kinship to surface dwarves can be compared to that of the Drow to surface Elf folk.",,,,
"Gold dwarves, are a subterranean subrace of dwarves, and are known for their confidence and keen intuition. The culture of their Deep Kingdom values family, ritual, and fine craftmanship.",,,,
"Shield dwarves, are a subterranean subrace of dwarves, survived a long fall from grace, surrendering many of their ancient kingdoms in wars with goblins and orcs. These losses have lead to a cynical mindset, yet shield dwarves will endure anything to restore their ancestral homelands.",,,,
"Barbarians can be excellent warriors. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly throw himself into a berserker rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent. Barbarians can't use plate mail armor, unlike the other three warrior classes. They use the fighter avatar for their appearance. In Throne of Bhaal, the Barbarian can draw from a high level ability pool which gives the barbarian some extra abilities.",,,,
"The Fighter is a champion, swordsman, swordswoman, soldier, and brawler who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics. Fighters can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good Fighter needs to be strong and healthy if they hope to survive.",,,,
"Typically, humans can define and categorize themselves by their place of origin (Spirans, Galbadians) or by their appearances (such as skin color), however there are Humans, Human races, or types of human, that possess unique classifications largely due to certain unique abilities.",,,,
"The Elves are a peaceful race that reside in Elfheim. Their leader is the Prince of Elfheim, and they are related to the Dark Elves, the leader of whom has cast the Prince of Elfheim into a deep sleep. The Elf King and his descendants were trusted with the Mystic Key by the royal family of Cornelia, to keep until the fabled Warriors of Light arrived in Elfheim to claim it. The Elves have four magic shops in their town and are of relatively small stature, which seems to imply they favor magic over physical might.",,,,
"Dwarves are usually portrayed as skilled engineers, and almost always have a special password, usually    Lali-ho!"" or something similar. Depending on the game, they may have a friendly or hostile relationship with the Elves, or none at all.""",,,,
"Men bear the Gift of Men, which is mortality, and therefore they age and die when their time comes, and are susceptible to illness and disease. Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease. Even the Valar did not know what ultimate fate awaited the souls of Men, as this was known only to Eru.",,,,
Elves were immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.,,,,
"Elves, like Men, are Children of Eru Iluvatar and thus are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. Some Elves in the First Age living near Angband died from a wasting disease, which was presumably issuing from Thangorodrim, Morgoth's fortress. The Elves came into existence before Men, and when Elves die they pass to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.",,,,
"Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force; one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable. Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown.",,,,
"Elves are (generally) unusually beautiful in face and body. There is little physical difference between males and females except that which is required for reproduction. They have far better vision and hearing than Men. They also have skills and abilities beyond what is possible for Men, and many can craft seemingly magical objects. In The Silmarillion, it is mentioned that the Elves are indeed closest in kin to the Ainur, given that Elves possess ethereal grace and various powers. Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink.  They do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire. Although the Elves are more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them thus Elves do require sustenance.",,,,
"Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than hobbits but much broader and heavier. Most Dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts.",,,,
"They seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle their soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and styles that were trademarks of Dwarven crafting styles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon.",,,,
"They had a knack for starting a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything. Although they knew how, Dwarves did not farm or herd often, as they preferred to spend their time underground mining and crafting. They rather traded crafted items with Men and Elves in exchange for food.",,,,
"They were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithying skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the Elves, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The skill of the Dwarves was unmatched; they crafted objects of great beauty out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire. Everything Dwarven was beautifully crafted and intricate. They crafted many famed weapons, armors, and items of art and beauty, among them Narsil, the sword of Elendil, the Dragon-helm of Dor-lomin and the Nauglamir necklace.",,,,
"Dwarves were taught special skills by the Vala Aule and spent most of their time crafting, smithying and mining in their massive underground cities.",,,,
"Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than Men,        often up to two-hundred-and-fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone.",,,,
"Dwarven women were alike in manner, voice and appearance to their menfolk. They were few in number, less than a third of all dwarf-kind, and they were seldom seen outside their own halls, often not venturing far due to their duties as caretakers and crafters in Dwarven society. They typically only travelled when in great need, and they usually dressed similarly to Dwarf men. This often led other folk to believe there were no women among the Dwarves, that Dwarves grew from stone when created. Few female Dwarven warriors were known, but some tales say that female Dwarves were as fierce as their male counterparts, especially in protecting their families and offspring. Dwarves were usually monogamous, and fewer than one-third of Dwarven men took a wife, the rest busying themselves with their crafts.",,,,
"Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to.",,,,
"Elves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary.",,,,
"Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races. Like their kin the eladrin, elves were agile, dexterous creatures. However, elves could move slightly faster than their eladrin kin and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Elves were also more preternaturally aware of their surroundings than eladrin, as well as possessing better common sense. This aided elves in many ways, allowing elves a high degree of perceptiveness that they could lend partially to allies. Additionally, elves were extremely accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids.",,,,
"Elves were usually found in small tribes throughout the forests of Toril, as well as on windswept plains and in mountain vales. The elves, as a whole, preferred these secluded places of nature to the cities and nations of the civilized world, living in harmony with their natural surroundings. Cautious and cunning warriors, particularly of the bow, elves secured these homelands through guile and tactics.",,,,
"Elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, though they were not usually considered past adolescence until they reached 110 years of age. Unlike humans, elves did not age dramatically as their lifespan came to a close, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening. Most elves remained healthy and full of life up until their death, which, if age-related, was usually between two and nine centuries.",,,,
"Many elves did not sleep, instead finding their rest in a meditative state called reverie"", which was as restful as true sleep but left them aware of their surroundings, similar to an eladrin's ability to enter a trance.""",,,,
"Dwarves, sometimes called the Stout Folk and Deep Folk, were a natural humanoid race common throughout parts of Toril as well as Abeir. Dwarves were a tough, tradition-abiding folk known for their strong martial traditions and beautiful craftsmanship.",,,,
"Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 4'3 to 4'9"" (1.3 - 1.45 meters) on average, with gold dwarves a bit shorter. What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk"," they were, on average, about as heavy as humans. A dwarf could weigh anywhere from about 160 - 220 lbs (73 - 100 kg). Dwarven males were a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts. Like humans, dwarves had a wide variety of skin, eye, and hair colors, typically pale among shield dwarves and deeply tanned or brown amongst gold dwarves. Hazel eyes were common throughout the race, with blue eyes more common amongst shield dwarves and brown or green eyes found amongst the gold dwarves.""",,,
"Male dwarves were often bald and grew thick facial hair, which was sometimes used to display social status. Unusually for humanoids, both sexes naturally grew ample facial hair, though the majority of shield dwarf females shaved their beards off. This hair was often dark in hue, though among shield dwarves blond or red hair was just as common. Gold dwarves took the care of facial hair to an extreme, carefully oiling and grooming it, with some adding perfume and ornamentations.",,,,
"Dwarves were a long-lived race, though not so much as elves, and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she reached age fifty. Dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer period of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 years. Most dwarves lived to see their bicentennial  and a few lived to be over 400. A dwarf was considered to be young until they reached the age of 50.",,,,
"Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes.  Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity.",,,,
"Dwarven friendship was hard to earn, but was strong once won. Naturally dour and suspicious, the stout folk were slow to trust others, specifically those outside their family, suspecting the worst of an individual until the outsider had proved their good will many times. Once this trust was gained, dwarves held their friends to it and viewed betrayals, even minor ones, with a vicious propensity for vengeance.  A common gnomish oath, remarking on this dwarven sense of justice, was If I'm lying, may I cross a dwarf.""""",,,,
"A dwarf advises on a matter of diplomacy.For dwarves, loyalty was more than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. Dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. Many dwarven tales subsequently revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. Just as dwarves were known for their dependability as friends and allies, dwarves also harbored grudges far longer than many other races. This might be on an individual basis between a dwarf and one who had wronged them, or against entire races, even if warfare with the enemy had long since ceased.",,,,
"Dwarves were careful and deliberate, with a more serious disposition than other races, who they sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. A dwarf did all things with care and a stubborn resolve, with brash or cowardly behavior unusual for them. However, dwarves did succumb easily to wrath or greed, which were their most common vices.",,,,
"Dwarves who left their homeland to become adventurers did so for a number of reasons. In part, a dwarf might be motivated by simple avarice, given the dwarven love of beautiful things. As often, however, a dwarf might be motivated by a drive to do what was right for others (particularly their clan) or a love of excitement because, as settled as dwarves were, they rarely tired of thrills. But even these wayward dwarves retained the spirit of their brethren, hoping that their accomplishments abroad could bring honor to themselves, their clan, or both. Given that successful dwarven adventurers were likely to recover rare items or defeat enemies of the dwarven people during such challenges, this was a hope not entirely without merit.",,,,
"Dwarves were unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, were resistant to virtually all poisons and it took less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also had dense bodies and were difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads that other races might find hindering with little ill effect. Dwarves also had a sense about them that few races did, with a preternatural awareness of their surroundings useful for a subterranean race as well as good judgment all-around in general.",,,,
"Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as halflings or gnomes, though this was not a trait common to all dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely unsocial and more than a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, something that sat well with their legendary crafting abilities.",,,,
"Dwarves could see in the dark, out to about 60 feet (18 meters). Many dwarves had an affinity for the caverns in which they lived, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could seem almost supernatural at times.",,,,
"A dwarf having a snooze after eating.Dwarves highly valued the ties between family members and friends, weaving tightly knit clans. Dwarves particularly respected elders, from whom they expected sound leadership and the wisdom of experience, as well as ancestral heroes or clan founders. This idea carried on to relations with other races and dwarves were deferential even to the elders of another, non-dwarven race.",,,,
"Likewise, dwarves, perhaps moreso than most other races, turned to their gods for guidance and protection. Non-evil dwarves looked to the divine for comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for methods through which to obtain power over others. Individual dwarves might be faithless, but the race as a whole, regardless of subrace, had a strong inclination for religion and almost every community maintained at least one temple or ancestral shrine.",,,,
"Most dwarven societies were divided into clans built along family ties and political allegiances. These clans were usually led by hereditary rulers, often monarchs of a sort and descended from the founder of the clan. Dwarves strongly valued loyalty to these rulers and to the clan as a whole and even objective dwarves tended to side primarily with their kin over other races or communities.",,,,
These clan structures promoted a tradition of inbreeding. This was so excessive that it was considered one of the reasons for the dwarves' low birth rate.,,,,
"Most dwarven clans focused on one or two kinds of crafting, such as blacksmithing, jewelry, engineering, or masonry. Dwarves strove to avoid overspecialization by sending some of their youths to other clans to serve as apprentices, which also helped to foster racial unity. Because of their longevity, these apprenticeships might last decades.",,,,
"Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface and above the Underdark, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did.",,,,
"Barbarians had a reputation, perhaps not completely deserved, as reckless ruffians and savage nuisances who needless disrupted society by acts of mayhem. However, barbarians, while undoubtedly feral and unpredictable by the nature of their rages, were not necessarily uncultured brutes. Time and time again, barbarians proved their cunning and resourcefulness as well as their sheer physical power and endurance. Sometimes, in spite of their aversion to an organized order, barbarians even demonstrated honor.",,,,
"A female barbarian striking down with her blade.However, barbarians were united - no matter their origins - by a marked lack of discipline or patience for the laws and traditions that others adhered to. Likewise, while a generalization, it is true to some degree that nearly all barbarians came from outside the confines of settled civilization, being far more common among nomadic tribes or frontier settlers than they were among urban city dwellers. It is from these remote origins that barbarians often derived their reverence for nature, which brought them closer to druids, rangers, and others who venerated the wilderness.",,,,
"Many barbarians were human, since humans were among the most widespread of the races, as well as in many cases, the most uncivilized. However, orc and goblinoid barbarians were more common still and were sometimes the most commonly encountered warriors of their race. Barbarians from other races were relatively rare, though among elves there were the wild elves, among halflings the ghostwise, and among dwarves the wild dwarves, each of which possessed barbarian traditions. Half-elves from the Yuirwood were also sometimes drawn to the way of the barbarian, as were planetouched raised among tribal cultures. Dragonborn, goliath, and half-elven barbarians were also somewhat common, with dragonborns and half-elves preferring the way of thaneborn barbarians, while goliaths were more often rageblood barbarians.",,,,
"Barbarians held varying attitudes towards magic. On the one hand, barbarians distrusted most things they did not understand and this extended towards what they called book magic"" or magic learned in a school or university, such as that used by swordmages or wizards.  On the other hand, barbarians were themselves wielders of primal magic, as were the druids many barbarians called friends or allies. Likewise, barbarians often showed a large degree of respect for sorcerers, whose approach to magic was similar to their own unbridled style of combat. In no small way, it was likely that the barbarian prejudice against scholarly magic was due in some part to the fact that many barbarians were illiterate.""",,,,
"Barbarians' bravery and wanderlust made them uncommonly suited for the adventuring lifestyle. Often coming from nomadic tribes, most barbarians had few qualms with the traveling life typical to adventuring parties. Of the difficulties suffered by barbarians in adapting to a life of adventure, the greatest was most commonly the loss of family structure that comes from leaving the tribe. With time, however, many barbarians found the bonds with their new companions a worthy substitute.",,,,
"A group of dragonborn barbarians.As handy with a weapon as a fighter, barbarians became tougher and more agile as they grew more powerful. The most experienced barbarians were almost incomparably powerful, with a strength and constitution well beyond that of most mortals.  Though barbarians often used one-handed weapons, many preferred to use two-handed weapons in order to deal more damage to their foes. Barbarians were also well-versed in the use of light armor, and many lacked training in heavier forms of protection such as chain shirts or shields, while very few were trained in and most lacked training in heavy armor, such as plate mail.",,,,
"Because most of them were untrained in the use of heavy armor, barbarians trained themselves to take incredible amounts of punishment that could easily fell less sturdy warriors. Additionally, most barbarians were capable of moving much more quickly while wearing half plate or lighter armor, by a factor of between thirty and forty percent. Another boon to barbarians' feral and exposed style of attack was their aptitude for quickly following up one attack with another immediately thereafter, overwhelming their enemies until they were able to deal fatal blow. This, along with their instinctive sense for danger, which made them nigh impossible to flank effectively or put off guard, made barbarians far more formidable than their lightly armored appearance would suppose.",,,,
"Many barbarians drew upon the primal energies of the natural world and its guardian spirits, often in the form of ancestral totems, for empowerment, gaining powerful abilities called evocations.  The feral might gained by barbarians could manifest in many other ways and some used it to empower themselves to the point of nigh invulnerability, finding it easier to take blows and plow onward rather than dodge them. Others gained the ability to literally shape their fate, affecting the quality of luck dealt them through force of will.",,,,
"The most distinctive aspect of barbarians was their ability to rage,"" wherein they let loose powerful emotional bursts fueled by their primal power or inner fury.  When they raged, barbarians gained a number of powerful benefits, including an increase in physical prowess, and greater insensitivity to many forms of physical damage. This rage usually lasted about a minute, but with experience and training, most barbarians could extend it indefinitely.""",,,,
"Barbarians also were known to take on other, less common abilities. While raging, barbarians were typically unable to cast evocations, spells, or other similar abilities.  Some barbarians were more skilled with lesser evocations whilst raging. Barbarians could also use a fraction of their raging power to deal a devastating attack known as a rage strike.",,,,
"Barbarians came in a number of different varieties, with a number of diverse capabilities. Two of the main divergent branches of barbarians were the path of the berserker and the path of the totem warrior.",,,,
"Where some barbarians drew upon the essence of nature and primal magic for their power, barbarians on the Path of the Berserker instead relied on their own fury and unbridled bloodlust to pull them through a fight. As a result, berserkers relied less extensively on primal magic and instead focused on improving their rage ability. When a berserker raged they could enter into an even deeper state of primal fury known as a frenzy. While frenzied, a berserker was capable of attacking more quickly, although such effort eventually tired them out. Raging berserkers were also utterly fearless and immune to the effects of charms.",,,,
"In addition to utilizing their rage in a way far greater than other barbarians, berserkers were also much more frightening to behold. Sufficiently powerful berserkers could actually cause their enemies to run in terror from them through their presence alone. Experienced berserkers also maintained exceptionally good battle reflexes, allowing them to strike a retaliatory blow to anyone who injured them in a fight.",,,,
"Barbarians with a more spiritual side pursued the Path of the Totem Warrior, a calling which enhanced the barbarians' capacity for primal magic and forging a strong connection between them and their spirit animal. The spirit animal chosen by Totem Warriors - which was often related to their particular tribal culture - granted them a number of supernatural abilities, such as the ability to carry extra weight, enhance the ability of their allies in battle, or even fly a limited distance in short bursts. Additionally, Totem Warriors also sometimes took on physical features similar to their spirit animal, such as excess hair or unusually colored eyes.",,,,
"In addition to the abilities mentioned above, Totem Warriors also gained the ability to cast druid spells such as beast sense or speak with animals as rituals. Their ability with these spells were somewhat limited compared with that of a druid, but nonetheless allowed the Totem Warrior to tap into the primal essence of nature in order to enhance their awareness or gather information.",,,,
"Wizards were a form of a spellcaster who learned the art of arcane magic through research and learning.  What wizards lacked in combat prowess and armor they made up with a broad range of magical spells and abilities learned through years of practice and training. Through their spellcasting ability, powerful wizards could control the battlefield, using spells that affected wide areas, often hindering enemies, while also learning to use powerful rituals of arcane power.",,,,
"Wizards were generally the best-respected of all arcane spellcasters since they usually had a measure of discipline that was uncommon among other arcane spellcasters, particularly sorcerers or warlocks whose very nature made them comparatively unruly. Not all wizards were deserving of this reputation, however, and wizards could be as easily chaotic or evil as any other class. Prior to the Spellplague, wizards as a whole were associated with the good goddess Mystra, whom many worshiped, though Mystra's death had ended this. Others worshiped Mystra's evil adversary, Shar, the goddess of darkness, giving them an entirely different reputation. With the return of Mystra after the Second Sundering, wizards once again fell under her purview.",,,,
"The mark of a wizard.Wizards had a wide variety of powers called spells available to them, fueled by the arcane energy of the universe. Prior to the Spellplague, these powers flowed from the Weave, which was governed by the goddess Mystryl, followed by Mystra, and then by Midnight. Since the Spellplague, magic no longer requires a god's governance, though many gods remained associated with arcane magic.",,,,
"A wizard's spells differed from those of other arcane spellcasters usually in terms of usage or scale. While a warlock's spells were primarily malevolent and a swordmage might use defensive spells that empowered themselves, a wizard used their power to control the nature of a battle, a landscape, or even the physical makeup of the universe itself. When in combat, a wizard favored spells that hindered many enemies at once, rather than attacking one, or that empowered themselves or allies.",,,,
"When casting spells, wizards often used arcane foci, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands. These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically.",,,,
"Wizards were also skilled in the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells which a wizard can only master once per day), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual.",,,,
A familiar was a normal animal that gained new powers and became a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard.,,,,
"Wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. In particular, they learn most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their spellbooks, a method that allows them, unlike bards or sorcerers, to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards see themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, and scientists, studying a system of natural laws that are for the most part unknown and undiscovered.",,,,
"This is the common view of a wizard casting: voicing several strange words, utilizing some arcane component (such as tossing pixie dust into the air), and perhaps making some sort of quirky hand movement. In actuality every part of the sequence must be exact or else the wizard may miscast, misfire, cast an entirely different spell, or cast nothing at all.",,,,
"A wizard still in his apprentice stage.Wizards may specialize in one or more of eight schools of magic, choosing their specialty early on in their training. This specialization is sometimes required in order to join the ranks of some of the world's most prestigious wizards, such as the Red Wizards of Thay, who require all initiates to be specialized in one of the schools of magic.",,,,
"Specialist wizards are treated and regarded as wizards by the world at large in spite of this specialization and many regarded themselves as such, though sometimes distinctions are made for diviners, illusionists, and necromancers. Some Elves, Half-elves, and Gnomes in the past practiced Dualism, specializing exclusively in two opposing schools to the exclusion of all others. Nonetheless, all of the following are simply considered wizard variants by the magic casting community.",,,,
"Wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or interact with other spells, are known as abjurers. These wizards are usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. Abjurers like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters.",,,,
Abjurers in battle are not as much a danger to those who forego magic for martial combat but those who use arcane or even divine spells will find abjurers deadly opponents. As aforementioned abjurers are often well-prepared for combating spellcasters of all stripes and are a valuable addition to any team intent on fighting wielders of supernatural abilities.,,,,
"Because of their propensity for deliberant action more abjurers are lawful than not, though any alignment is possible. While abjurer's care and disdain for reckless action makes many good some are drawn to their talents by promises of power over other spellcasters. Abjurers only reluctantly adventure and are most often found in small villages where they enjoy the trust and good regards of friends and neighbors.",,,,
"Conjurers are wizards who specialize in conjuration, the magical art of summoning and teleportation. Conjurers are often headstrong and disdainful towards other schools of magic, seeing most as weak or inconsequential, with the exception of necromancy, which they hold to be repulsive. Conjurers can be difficult companions since many are so independent-minded that only an unusually strong-willed leader can earn their respect.",,,,
"Stereotypes of conjurers and sorcerers are often similar, with the reputation of conjurers being that they tend to see magic as a blunt instrument. In battle, conjurers do tend to be unflinching in danger, confident in their summoned power to overcome any threat.",,,,
"The typical conjurer is chaotic in alignment and in a reversal of the wizard stereotype favor quick and easy solutions over long and carefully planned out ones. Many are also evil or neutral, unperturbed by paths to power that involve unsavory, evil or outright despicable methods. Most conjurers like isolation, as it means they can carry out their dangerous experiments undisturbed by others and only leave their enclaves either to accumulate more power or the necessary wealth to continue their research.",,,,
"Those wizards who specialize in the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or a far away location, are known as diviners. Diviners are notable for possessing an unusually high wisdom for wizards, with strong and cautious judgment, preferring to use violence only as a last resort. Many diviners are also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all matters.",,,,
"Diviners are not necessarily cowards but exhaust all other options before proceeding into combat. While diviners can be useful due to their anticipation of others' attacks some are irritatingly hesitant, making them nigh useless at times. When forced into battle, diviners are in natural opposition to illusionists, whose tricks they can unravel with their own spells.",,,,
"Because of their deliberate approach to matters most diviners are lawful, though their tendency towards inaction also makes many neutral. Diviners are not often adventurers, in part because of their loner nature, but when they are they are highly valued. Good diviners use their foresight to prevent harm from coming to others while evil ones can use it obtain control over others. Diviners of all stripes often cover their costs by serving as seers or fortunetellers.",,,,
"An eccentric apprentice.Enchantment, also known as charming, is the arcane art of influencing or controlling the actions of others and enchanters are those wizards who specialize in the school. More than a few enchanters have an unusually high charisma and degree of charm about them for a wizard, possessing a naturally outgoing and attractive personality. Even if they lack charisma however, enchanters can sway the opinions or actions of others - so long as they cast a charm spell first, which draws on their intelligence.",,,,
"Enchanters work with their allies more closely than some of the more single-minded wizard variants and this is one of their strengths. Enchanters use their spells to overcome social obstacles, convince enemies to lay down arms, or put foes into a daze. The most dangerous ability of an enchanter is their ability to turn an enemy into an ally, or vice versa, or to incapacitate an enemy in such a way that renders them as good as dead.",,,,
"Enchanters can be good or evil and have no overall strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters are chaotic over evil, though only by a slim margin. Good enchanters are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another's being's free will, while evil enchanters show little such restraint.    Enchanters of all kinds enjoy company and typically are found in large cities rather than small communities where their talents are put to little use.",,,,
"Evocation magic is a unique blend of arcane magic with the elemental power of creation and those who specialize in it are known as evokers. Evokers are often stubbornly determined by nature and have little use for distractions of the real world, living in very often spartan conditions. Many evokers are decisive and forthright, who are sure of what they must do, be it good or evil, giving them many qualities of strong leadership.",,,,
"Evokers are naturally adept at combat, making them some of the most common wizard adventurers. Most evocation spells have an immediately obvious combat application, such as magic missile or fireball and make evokers valued combatants who often serve as a form of magical artillery on the battlefield.",,,,
"Evokers have no strong tendencies towards law or chaos and both good and evil evokers are common. Good evokers perceive evil as a force that must immediately be opposed by their power and evil evokers find evocation magic a fast and comparatively easy way to power. In spite of the sheer lack of subtlety in many evocation spells, or perhaps because of it, most evokers live in small and quiet homes or even as hermits. This is perhaps for the best and many, sometimes rightly, fear the power evokers can wield.",,,,

Various depictions of elves.,,,,
"Elves, much like their living ancestors, the eladrin, who were also commonly called elves, were a long-lived race of the Tel-quessir found most commonly in forests, shrublands, and other wildernesses. From time to time the elves organized strong nations, though with far less frequency than eladrin, in some cases adopting even a nomadic lifestyle. Almost all elves worshiped the gods of the Seldarine, and the elves were generally, though not always, good in nature.",,,,
"Elves stood on average 5â€²4â€³â€’6â€²0â€³ (1.6â€’1.8m) and weighed 130â€’170lb (59â€’77kg). Usually, true elves were a naturally slender and athletic race. Elves had a similar range of complexions to humans, with wood elves typically coppery or pale skinned and wild elves having darker pigmentation. Often, elven hair was dark, either brown or black, with copper red or blond hair also found amongst wood elves, although orange or even green hues were not completely unheard of. Elven eyes are commonly brown, hazel, or an emerald green. Elves, like their cousins the eladrin, were fair and beautiful, handsome, and had pointed ears and no body hair except eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair.",,,,
"Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to.",,,,
"Elves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary.",,,,
"Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races. Like their kin the eladrin, elves were agile, dexterous creatures. However, elves could move slightly faster than their eladrin kin and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Elves were also more preternaturally aware of their surroundings than eladrin, as well as possessing better common sense. This aided elves in many ways, allowing elves a high degree of perceptiveness that they could lend partially to allies. Additionally, elves were extremely accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids.",,,,
"elf, plural Elves, in Germanic folklore, originally, a spirit of any kind, later specialized into a diminutive creature, usually in tiny human form. In the Prose, or Younger, Edda, elves were classified as light elves (who were fair) and dark elves (who were darker than pitch)",,,,

"Some, known afterwards as the Calaquendi (Elves of the Light), were brought by the Valar from Middle-earth to ValinorÂ across the Sea, where they were taught by the Ainur. But after the Silmarils were stolen by Melkor, some of the Elves returned to Middle-earth, where they remained until the end of the Third Age.[4]",,,,
Elves were immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime. They could be killed only in violence or by extreme despair.,,,,
"At Lake CuiviÃ©nen, by Ted NasmithThe Firstborn, the Elder Children of IlÃºvatar, were conceived by Eru IlÃºvatar alone in the third theme of AinulindalÃ«. They are the eldest and noblest of the speaking races of Middle-earth. They awoke at CuiviÃ©nen, the Water of Awakening, in the far east of Middle-earth, in the starlight of the Sleep of Yavanna, as the Sun and Moon had yet to be created. The first Elves to awake were three pairs: Imin (""First"") and his wife IminyÃ«, Tata (""Second"") and TatiÃ«, and Enel (""Third"") and EnelyÃ«.[5]",,,,
"According to legend, Imin, Tata, and Enel, and their wives joined up and walked through the forests. They came across six, nine, and twelve pairs of Elves, and each ""patriarch"" claimed the pairs as his folk in order. The now sixty Elves dwelt by the rivers, and they invented poetry and music in Middle-earth. Journeying further, they come across a band of Elves watching the stars, which Tata claimed as his. These were tall and dark-haired, the fathers of most of the Ã‘oldor. The ninety-six Elves now invented many new words. Continuing their journey, they found twenty-four pairs of Elves, singing without language, and Enel added them to his people. These were the ancestors of most of the Lindar or ""singers"", later called Teleri. They found no more Elves",,,,
"At first the Elves sang with grace and merriment without speech but soon they developed speech and spoke with words, so their first name for themselves was Quendi (The Ones Who Speak With Voices).",,,,
"The Elves were content and dwelt long under the stars in woods near CuiviÃ©nen. However, Melkor, the Dark Lord, became aware of them and their location before the Valar, and sent evil spirits to spy on and afflict them. Many spirits that harassed the Elves came in the form of great horsemen for the purpose of causing the Elves to fear the Vala OromÃ«, whom Melkor knew would likely be the first Vala to discover them. And so it was that, on one of his many journeys in the wilds of Middle-earth, OromÃ« came upon the Elves. Due to Melkor's foresight and malice, some Elves were afraid. Hiding and fleeing, some of these early Elves were taken by Melkor or his agents. These Elves were never seen again and were taken to Utumno, and were believed to be twisted and mutilated into the first Orcs. However, the Elves who stayed quickly learned that OromÃ« was far different from the evils that had been pursuing them. OromÃ« quickly came to love the Elves, and them and gave them the name Eldar (People of the Stars).[7][8]",,,,
"Elves, like Men, are Children of Eru IlÃºvatar and thus are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. Some Elves in the First Age living near Angband died from a wasting disease, which was presumably issuing from Thangorodrim, Morgoth's fortress. The Elves came into existence before Men, and when Elves die they pass to the Halls of Mandos in Valinor.",,,,
"Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink",,,,
"They do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire.",,,,

"In the Etymologies (a linguistic manuscript from ca. 1937-8 published posthumously) is stated that ""the Quendian ears were more pointed and leaf-shaped than Human.""[4][5] In another linguistic manuscript (from ca. 1959-60), the Elvish connection between ears and leaves is again noted: ""Amon Lhaw. Â¶SLAS-, ear. las, leaf. slasÅ« > Q hlaru, S lhaw.""[6][7]",,,,

"In general, the Vanyar were golden-haired, with the name Vanyar meaning ""the Fair"" in Quenya and referring to their light-coloured hair.[source?] Other Elves - including the Noldor, Sindar, and Avari - had dark brown or black hair like FinwÃ« or Maeglin.[10][note 1] LÃºthien TinÃºviel and her remote descendant Arwen UndÃ³miel, both described as the fairest of all Elves, were dark haired. Additionally, a silver hair colour existed among the Teleri and in the royal houses of the Sindar, with Thingol, CÃ­rdan and Celeborn all described as having silver hair.[11]",,,,
"In some cases elves had atypical hair colour, either due to simple happenstance or intermarriage between clans. A prime example is the royal house of the Noldor and their descendants: MÃ­riel SerindÃ« of the Noldor, the first wife of FinwÃ« and mother of FÃ«anor, is described as having silvery hair.[12] FÃ«anor himself possessed ""raven-dark"" hair,[13] but not all the sons of FÃ«anor shared this trait",,,,
"Another Noldo with noteworthy hair colour was Glorfindel, whose hair is described as ""shining gold"" in colour.[16] Idril, the daughter of Turgon, King of Gondolin, had golden hair inherited from her mother, ElenwÃ« of the Vanyar. Thranduil, father of Legolas and a Sindarin Elf, is described as having ""golden"" hair in The Hobbit,[17] but Legolas' own hair colour is not recorded. The golden hair colour is sometimes implied among the other Elves: Amroth, a Sindarin Elf of LothÃ³rien is one such case, whose hair is described as ""bright"" and shining like a spark of gold in the sun.[15] In The Lord of the Rings, a very similar reference is made for an Elf of LothÃ³rien who had hair that ""glinted like gold"" in the sun.[18]",,,,
"When Tolkien describes Elven eyes, they tend to be grey. This is certainly true of LÃºthien and her descendants, including Elrond and his children (Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir) as well as Aragorn and the DÃºnedain. VoronwÃ«, who guided the man Tuor to Gondolin, also had grey eyes.",,,,

"Wizards were a form of a spellcaster who learned the art of arcane magic through research and learning.[10] What wizards lacked in combat prowess and armor they made up with a broad range of magical spells and abilities learned through years of practice and training. Through their spellcasting ability, powerful wizards could control the battlefield, using spells that affected wide areas, often hindering enemies, while also learning to use powerful rituals of arcane power. [11]",,,,
"Wizards were generally the best-respected of all arcane spellcasters since they usually had a measure of discipline that was uncommon among other arcane spellcasters, particularly sorcerers or warlocks whose very nature made them comparatively unruly. Not all wizards were deserving of this reputation, however, and wizards could be as easily chaotic or evil as any other class. Prior to the Spellplague, wizards as a whole were associated with the good goddess Mystra, whom many worshiped, though Mystra's death had ended this. Others worshiped Mystra's evil adversary, Shar, the goddess of darkness, giving them an entirely different reputation. With the return of Mystra after the Second Sundering, wizards once again fell under her purview.[12]",,,,
"Elminster Aumar, the Sage of Shadowdale, was by far the best-known example of a wizard.",,,,
"The mark of a wizard.Wizards had a wide variety of powers called spells available to them, fueled by the arcane energy of the universe. Prior to the Spellplague, these powers flowed from the Weave, which was governed by the goddess Mystryl, followed by Mystra, and then by Midnight. Since the Spellplague, magic no longer requires a god's governance, though many gods remained associated with arcane magic.",,,,
"A wizard's spells differed from those of other arcane spellcasters usually in terms of usage or scale. While a warlock's spells were primarily malevolent and a swordmage might use defensive spells that empowered themselves, a wizard used their power to control the nature of a battle, a landscape, or even the physical makeup of the universe itself. When in combat, a wizard favored spells that hindered many enemies at once, rather than attacking one, or that empowered themselves or allies.[14]",,,,
"When casting spells, wizards often used arcane foci, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands.[15] These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically.[16]",,,,
"Wizards were also skilled in the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells which a wizard can only master once per day), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual. [17]",,,,
A familiar was a normal animal that gained new powers and became a magical beast when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard.,,,,
"Wizards cast their spells by using their acquired magical knowledge and experience. In particular, they learn most new spells by seeking out magical writings and copying them into their spellbooks, a method that allows them, unlike bards or sorcerers, to master any number of permissible spells once they find them, assembling a broad and versatile arsenal of power. Many wizards see themselves not only as spell casters but as philosophers, inventors, and scientists, studying a system of natural laws that are for the most part unknown and undiscovered. ",,,,
"This is the common view of a wizard casting: voicing several strange words, utilizing some arcane component (such as tossing pixie dust into the air), and perhaps making some sort of quirky hand movement. In actuality every part of the sequence must be exact or else the wizard may miscast, misfire, cast an entirely different spell, or cast nothing at all.",,,,
"A wizard still in his apprentice stage.Wizards may specialize in one or more of eight schools of magic, choosing their specialty early on in their training. This specialization is sometimes required in order to join the ranks of some of the world's most prestigious wizards, such as the Red Wizards of Thay, who require all initiates to be specialized in one of the schools of magic.",,,,
"Specialist wizards are treated and regarded as wizards by the world at large in spite of this specialization and many regarded themselves as such, though sometimes distinctions are made for diviners, illusionists, and necromancers. Some Elves, Half-elves, and Gnomes in the past practiced Dualism, specializing exclusively in two opposing schools to the exclusion of all others. Nonetheless, all of the following are simply considered wizard variants by the magic casting community.",,,,
"Wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or interact with other spells, are known as abjurers. These wizards are usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. Abjurers like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters."," Maedhros and the twins Amrod and Amras had auburn hair (though Amrod's hair grew darker after childhood).[14]:355 This rare red-brown hair colour was a trait of Nerdanel's kin, for her father Mahtan, had the epessÃ« Rusco 'fox' due to his hair colour.[14]:353 Finarfin, the youngest son of FinwÃ«, and his descendants had golden hair on account of FinwÃ«'s second wife, Indis of the Vanyar. Finarfin's daughter Galadriel displayed an extremely rare hair colour nowhere else observed"," golden-silver hair, said to be dazzlingly beautiful (""the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, had been snared in her tresses"").[15]",,
"Owing to my lack of tolerance for those who would use magic towards their own nefarious ends, many have assumed that I am averse to the practice of the magical arts on a philosophical level. Nothing could be farther from the truth. My quarrel is with those sorcerers who dismiss the ancient traditions and teachings â€“ teachings that have been honed over millennia in order to preserve respect for authority and the rule of law.",,,,
"Magic-users hail from academies throughout Sanctuary â€“ from Xiansai to Caldeum â€“ bearing monikers like ""Sorcerer"" and ""Mage,"" but those who refer to themselves with the derogatory epithet ""wizard"" are as similar to their fellow spellcasters as a lion is to a kitten. Wizards and Sorcerers both wield the hidden mysteries of the arcane",,,,
"Renegade spellcasters, many Wizards are obsessed with power, and are known for a number of qualities: not only rebelliousness and flair, but also disdain for the endless lessons and prattling about caution and safety that echo from academic schools of magic. Wizardsâ€™ superior attitudes seem to stem from their natural talent â€“ their ability to wrestle the ambient force of magic into submission and direct it to their ends by will and instinct. Any accidents that might occur due to their lack of finesse are unfortunate...but that rarely stops wizards from indulging in their unstable magic power. For Wizards, the risks of magic are irrelevant as long as the reward is great enough."," they loved all beauty of nature, especially water, the Sea and the stars, since they were the first things they saw", as a consequence Ulmo and Varda were the Ainur closest to them. They were marked by an insatiable curiosity and a desire of learning and creating.,,
"People feared the mages they named wizards. Wizards drove the world to the brink of destruction time and time again, mages of such untamed power that the earth trembled at their machinations. They treated with the demons of the Burning Hells and made pacts to give us all to ruin. They cheated death and tore the very fabric of creation.",,,,
"Wizards use their bodies as vessels for arcane energy, forsaking the more careful path favored by other magic users. Because of this use, wizards rarely find themselves without the power of magic. They can nearly always afford to cast their weaker spells thanks to their swiftly-regenerating arcane power, and they invoke certain powers more easily as their experience grows",,,,
"Wizards manipulate all manner of forces to disintegrate, burn, and freeze their foes, claiming dominion over Sanctuary's natural elements, and they can control time and light to teleport, create powerful illusions, and deflect oncoming attacks. Wizards grip wands and staves to focus their less potent magics, blasting at their enemies while gathering the energy or time necessary to destroy them in a dazzling hail of arcane might. Though all material items serve as channels for a wizardâ€™s immense power, orbs have special uses, in that they provide them with visions and knowledge to aid their spellcasting, or serve as reservoirs of power.",,,,
"With few exceptions, wizard attacks are conducted at a distance, away from danger. As living artillery, wizards are well suited to relying on long-range destructive power. Though not as physically agile or strong as some other heroes, wizards cloak themselves in defensive magics. They can encase their skin in diamonds, create mirror images to befuddle their enemies, and harm or slow those foolish enough to strike at them directly.",,,,
"Wizards are best known for their ability to cast spells which lead to various effects on creatures and objects. Their magic can be used for offensive ends, inflicting damage and status effects on the target. It can also be used for supportive goals, improving the stats of the mage or allies, and can be used to summon creatures. Generally, the mage's arcane magic cannot be used to heal",,,,
"Their mastery of the magical art comes at the price of weakness in physical combat, as they can neither absorb nor deal large amounts of physical damage. Mages are unable to use most heavy defensive equipment such as shields, headgear and body armor, instead they are largely restricted to magical robes and bracers. For that reason mages aren't usually found on the front line of large battles. They also have a limited selection of weapons, being restricted to staves, daggers, slings and darts, and may place no more than one skill point in any of these. Unlike Specialist Mages, mages can learn any spell from all eight schools of magic. Mages are free to choose any alignment they like.",,,,
"In order for mages to cast a spell, first they need to successfully scribe a mage spell scroll into their spellbook (scroll lost in process regardless of success or failure). A mage may have any number of spells scribed and available to memorize. They must choose which spells they will have available for immediate use by placing them into a limited number of spell slots. The mage must then rest for eight hours to memorize the spells, which prepares them for casting.",,,,
"The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, they study strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much of their time to magical research. A wizard must rely on knowledge and wit to survive. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic there are different types of wizards. The Mages study all types of magic and learn a wide variety of spells",,,,

"Dwarves, sometimes called the Stout Folk and Deep Folk,[5] were a natural humanoid race common throughout parts of Toril as well as Abeir.[6] Dwarves were a tough, tradition-abiding folk known for their strong martial traditions and beautiful craftsmanship.[7]",,,,
"Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 4'3""â€“4'9"" (1.3â€“1.45 meters) on average,[9] with gold dwarves a bit shorter.[10] What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk",,,,
"Male dwarves were often bald and grew thick facial hair, which was sometimes used to display social status. Unusually for humanoids, both sexes naturally grew ample facial hair,[12] though the majority of shield dwarf females shaved their beards off.[13] This hair was often dark in hue, though among shield dwarves blond or red hair was just as common. Gold dwarves took the care of facial hair to an extreme, carefully oiling and grooming it,[10] with some adding perfume and ornamentations.[12]",,,,
"Dwarves were a long-lived race, though not so much as elves, and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she reached age fifty.[11] Dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer period of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 years. Most dwarves lived to see their bicentennial[9] and a few lived to be over 400.[11] A dwarf was considered to be young until they reached the age of 50.[1]",,,,
"Whether or not the dwarven claim that they'd been carved from the world's stone was true, dwarves shared many qualities considered similar to the stone they lived with. Strong, hardy, and dependable, dwarves were polite, particularly to elders, and possessed a wisdom beyond that of many other races. Dwarves valued their traditions, regardless of the subrace they came from, and looked for inspiration from ancestral heroes.[9] Dwarves were also known for their stubborn nature and cynicism, traits widespread amongst the dwarves but which contributed to and were commonly offset by their bravery and tenacity.[10]",,,,
"Dwarven friendship was hard to earn, but was strong once won. Naturally dour and suspicious, the stout folk were slow to trust others, specifically those outside their family, suspecting the worst of an individual until the outsider had proved their good will many times. Once this trust was gained, dwarves held their friends to it and viewed betrayals, even minor ones, with a vicious propensity for vengeance.[10] A common gnomish oath, remarking on this dwarven sense of justice, was ""If I'm lying, may I cross a dwarf.""[11]",,,,
"A dwarf advises on a matter of diplomacy.For dwarves, loyalty was more than a word and they felt that it should be both valued and rewarded. Dwarves believed it a gift and mark of respect to stand beside a friend in combat, and an even deeper one to protect that ally from harm. Many dwarven tales subsequently revolved around the sacrifice of dwarves for their friends and family. Just as dwarves were known for their dependability as friends and allies, dwarves also harbored grudges far longer than many other races. This might be on an individual basis between a dwarf and one who had wronged them, or against entire races, even if warfare with the enemy had long since ceased.[9]",,,,
"Dwarves were careful and deliberate, with a more serious disposition than other races, who they sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. A dwarf did all things with care and a stubborn resolve, with brash or cowardly behavior unusual for them. However, dwarves did succumb easily to wrath or greed, which were their most common vices.[11]",,,,
"Dwarves who left their homeland to become adventurers did so for a number of reasons. In part, a dwarf might be motivated by simple avarice, given the dwarven love of beautiful things. As often, however, a dwarf might be motivated by a drive to do what was right for others (particularly their clan) or a love of excitement because, as settled as dwarves were, they rarely tired of thrills. But even these wayward dwarves retained the spirit of their brethren, hoping that their accomplishments abroad could bring honor to themselves, their clan, or both. Given that successful dwarven adventurers were likely to recover rare items or defeat enemies of the dwarven people during such challenges, this was a hope not entirely without merit.[11]",,,,
"Dwarves were unusually tough for humanoids, in more ways than one. Dwarven stomachs, for instance, were resistant to virtually all poisons and it took less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races. Dwarves also had dense bodies and were difficult to push around as a result, as well as having the capacity to bear loads that other races might find hindering with little ill effect. Dwarves also had a sense about them that few races did, with a preternatural awareness of their surroundings useful for a subterranean race as well as good judgment all-around in general.[9]",,,,
"Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as halflings or gnomes, though this was not a trait common to all dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely unsocial and more than a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, something that sat well with their legendary crafting abilities.[11]",,,,
"Dwarves could see in the dark, out to about 60 feet (18 meters). Many dwarves had an affinity for the caverns in which they lived, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could seem almost supernatural at times.[11]",,,,

"Likewise, dwarves, perhaps moreso than most other races, turned to their gods for guidance and protection. Non-evil dwarves looked to the divine for comfort and inspiration, while the wicked looked to their divine overlords for methods through which to obtain power over others. Individual dwarves might be faithless, but the race as a whole, regardless of subrace, had a strong inclination for religion and almost every community maintained at least one temple or ancestral shrine.",,,,
"Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface and above the Underdark, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did",,,,
"In their own homelands, dwarves continuously carved out new living space, mining the mountains' riches as they did so. Dwarves in general stuck to these locales, disliking travel, particularly along waterways, but those who lived in human lands could make themselves quite comfortable. Most who did made a living as mercenaries, smiths, or artisans of various kinds. Dwarves were eagerly sought after as warriors, their reputation for courage and loyalty making them excellent choices for bodyguards",,,,
"Dwarfves were firm believers in the righteousness of their own ways, yet were surprisingly tolerant of the cultures of others, much of which was due to their natural introversion. Polite dwarves normally declined to speak their minds about others regardless of their true feelings",,,,
"More than any other race, humans were capable of dwarven behavior, readily absorbing their virtues and able to value them almost equally. They looked up to the tradition, honor, conviction, and family values central to them, and admired dwarven martial skill and stonecraft. The two races had always been cordial neighbors at the very least, and when humans modeled their societies after dwarves, it was a source of pride and joy. However, humans were so morally and ethically flexible that they could also be almost elf-like, seeming flighty to their slow-paced ways. What all human nations shared was a short memory, and human adaptability was countered in their minds by cultural inconsistency. Still, if dwarves were good at anything, it was finding potential hidden below the surface, and so even in the darkest times, they never gave up on humanity.",,,,
"Like many races, the exact origins of the dwarves were lost in myth and legend. While many non-dwarven scholars believed that dwarves were not native to Abeir-Toril or its successor worlds, most dwarves believed that their ancestors came from the heart of the planet itself, given life by Moradin after being made by the All-Father."," there, the commonalities end.",,,

The shield dwarves saw parts of the North overrun and conquered by the orcs of Many Arrows while to the south the gold dwarves were largely driven from their underground kingdom in the Great Rift towards the surface world.

"The Dwarves were made by AulÃ«, whom they themselves called Mahal, meaning â€œmaker.â€ AulÃ« was unwilling to await the coming of the Children of IlÃºvatar, for he was impatient and desired to have someone to teach his lore and crafts. Therefore, he made the first seven Fathers of the Dwarves in secret, in a hall under the mountains of Middle-earth.",,,,
"AulÃ« Prepares to Destroy His Children by Ted NasmithIt was, however, not within AulÃ«'s power to create life. After being reprimanded by IlÃºvatar for creating them, and realizing his error, AulÃ« prepared to destroy his creations. But Eru intervened, adopting the Dwarves as his own Children, so that when AulÃ« picked up his great hammer to smite the Seven Fathers and destroy his presumptuous creations, they cowered in fear and begged for mercy.",,,,
"IlÃºvatar willed that the Dwarves would not emerge before the Firstborn Elves, and so he decreed that the Seven Fathers should sleep underground, and come forth after the Firstborn had awakened.[2]",,,,
"About a century after the Elves awoke in CuiviÃ©nen, the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves were roused. Of them, only the name of one is known, Durin I, who was called ""the deathless"". Each of Seven Fathers became a king of his own clan, and each built his own great hall. Three major holds are known to have been built in this period. Belegost and Nogrod were built in the Blue Mountains, and the Dwarves of these holds formed alliances with the Ã‘oldor and fought in their wars. Durin I, on the other hand, wandered into a vale in the Misty Mountains which he named Azanulbizar. In a still pool in that vale, he saw a reflection of himself with a crown of seven stars. Ever after, the constellation of stars that the Elves called Valacirca was called by the Dwarves Durinâ€™s Crown, and it could be seen reflected in the water at any time of the day, though only Durin could see his own reflection. Durin I named the lake Kheled-zÃ¢ram and proceeded to build his great halls of Khazad-dÃ»m within the mountains above. ",,,,
"In the First Age, the Dwarves made alliances with the Elves, and both prospered from trade. Dwarves from Belegost invented the famous Dwarf-mail of linked rings and fashioned the finest steel the world had ever seen. They also constructed the hall of Thingol, Menegroth, and were rewarded with the pearl Nimphelos. They fought alongside Elves and Men and participated in some of the major battles of the First Age, including The First Battle of Beleriand and the NÃ­rnaeth Arnoediad in which the Dwarves of Belegost won great renown for being the only ones able to stand against the dragon Glaurung, for 'it was their custom moreover to wear great masks in battle hideous to look upon', which 'set them good stead against dragons', and besides they were 'naturally able to resist fire better than Elves or Men'. In that battle, AzaghÃ¢l the Lord of Belegost was killed by Glaurung, who crawled over him. Before dying, the dwarf stabbed at the dragon's belly and 'pricked him so deep that he fled back to Angband'.",,,,
"Elderly DwarvesThe Dwarves of Nogrod were famous for the craftsmanship of their weapons. Most notable amongst their smiths was Telchar. Dwarves from Nogrod crafted the necklace NauglamÃ­r, and Thingol requested Dwarven smiths from Nogrod to set a Silmaril into that necklace. Thus were united the greatest works of Elves and Dwarves. Those Dwarf-smiths were driven mad by gold-lust, however, and murdered Thingol, stealing the necklace and the stone, igniting the bitter rivalry between Dwarves and Elves that would rage until the end of the Third Age.",,,,
"The Elves of Doriath pursued the smiths to their deaths and reclaimed the NauglamÃ­r. But two of the slayers of Thingol escaped from this, and in Nogrod told how Dwarves were slain by command of the Elven-king, who thus would cheat them of their just reward. The Dwarves of Nogrod lamented the deaths of their kin and their great craftsmen and took thought of vengeance. Though the Dwarves of Belegost tried to dissuade them from their purpose, the Dwarves of Nogrod invaded Doriath. After a hard battle in the Thousand Caves, the Dwarves of Nogrod were victorious and took the NauglamÃ­r and the Silmaril. On their return journey to the Blue Mountains, however, the Dwarves of Nogrod were assailed by a company that included Beren, his son Dior, and many Green-elves of Ossiriand. Many of the Dwarves were slain, and Beren himself slew the Lord of Nogrod and wrested from him the NauglamÃ­r necklace. Some of the Dwarves escaped from the battle, but they were ambushed in the slopes beneath Mount Dolmed by the Ents.",,,,
"Some stories from the First Age tell of ""Petty-dwarves"" who were called the Noegyth Nibin. Those Dwarves had been exiled from their homes during the Peace of Arda and were the first Dwarves to enter Beleriand. They first inhabited and carved out the Caverns of Narog, which they called NulukkizdÃ®n, later overtaken by Finrod and renamed Nargothrond. The last of the Petty-dwarves were MÃ®m and his two sons who lived at Amon RÃ»dh. MÃ®m aided TÃºrin in his adventures, but subsequently betrayed him to Orcs.",,,,
"Durin's FolkAfter the First Age, most accounts of Dwarves concern those of the line of Durin, who are commonly called Durinâ€™s Folk or Longbeards. Durin I enjoyed a very long life and lived through most of the First Age. Occasionally in the following ages, a Dwarf was born of this line so resembled Durin that he was considered to be Durin reborn. Prophecy told that Durin would be reborn seven times, and that the coming of Durin VII would mark the decline of the Dwarves.",,,,
"Durin II was born in the Second Age. It is untold exactly when, but either he or Durin III was in power when the smith Narvi built the Doors of Durin. His reign was an era of great prosperity in which the halls of Khazad-dÃ»m were greatly expanded and the Ã‘oldorin Elves of Lindon moved into Eregion to trade with the Dwarves for mithril. The population of Khazad-dÃ»m boomed, because many refugees from Belegost and Nogrod, which were destroyed at the end of the First Age, moved there.",,,,
"Dwarves were a short, stocky race, a little taller than hobbits but much broader and heavier. Most Dwarves had thick, luxuriant beards in which they took great pride, and often forked or braided them and tucked them into their belts.",,,,
"They seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle their soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and styles that were trademarks of Dwarven crafting styles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon.",,,,
"Dwarven women were alike in manner, voice and appearance to their menfolk. They were few in number, less than a third of all dwarf-kind, and they were seldom seen outside their own halls, often not venturing far due to their duties as caretakers and crafters in Dwarven society. They typically only travelled when in great need, and they usually dressed similarly to Dwarf men. This often led other folk to believe there were no women among the Dwarves, that Dwarves grew from stone when created. Few female Dwarven warriors were known, but some tales say that female Dwarves were as fierce as their male counterparts, especially in protecting their families and offspring. Dwarves were usually monogamous, and fewer than one-third of Dwarven men took a wife, the rest busying themselves with their crafts.",,,,
"Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than Men,[2] often up to two-hundred-and-fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone.",,,,
"Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to friends and family. They treat and care for each other, even strangers among their kind like family. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and gems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the Elves. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often seen as greedy, but their nature gave them resistance to many external influences, including to the evil of the Rings of Power given them. Whereas the Men who owned the nine Rings were corrupted and became the NazgÃ»l, the Dwarves were unaffected, save by an increase of their goldlust and hatred for anything that stood between them and what they perceived as their treasure.",,,,
"They were also capable masons and smiths - Dwarven smithying skills were said to be rivaled only by those of the Elves, and their masonry creations were bested by none. The skill of the Dwarves was unmatched"," behavior considered ""good enough"" was left alone and not considered their business. Certain violent behavior might prompt more direct forms of response, but for the most part dwarves would live and let live.

"the Dwarven language was created by AulÃ« when he created the Dwarves themselves, and called it 'Khuzdul', which simply meant 'Dwarvish'. The language was harsh sounding, and sounded strange to other peoples. No person who was not a Dwarf was permitted to learn any of its words, for it was guarded jealously. When around other races, the Dwarves seldom spoke in Khuzdul.",,,,
"Dwarven soldiers usually used axes as their weapon of choice because it can be used as a tool or a weapon, but in addition to axes they used hatchets, mattocks, short swords, war hammers, and very occasionally there is mention of Dwarven archers.",,,,

"Dwarves make excellent warriors because of their extremely high constitution. The very small selection of playable classes available for dwarves, second only to halflings, may discourage anyone wanting to play a dwarf that isn't the fighting type. They don't have as much strength as half-orcs, but their ungodly high saving throws more than makes up for it in the long run. While the 17 maximum in dexterity at character creation hurts their armor class, it can be boosted to 18 with the use of skill manuals. This will put your AC on par with any other race outside of halflings and elves.",,,,
"Those interested in playing thieves can still do so with a dwarf character because the dexterity restriction is actually balanced out by naturally high racial adjustments to thieving skills (particularly disarm traps, open locks and set traps). However, it should be noted that the high constitution bonus only applies to warrior classes and the steep charisma penalty dwarves suffer doesn't make them ideal as party leaders or for getting the best prices at stores.",,,,
