Gold is Leprechauns most beloved treasure. It is difficult for Leprechaun to part with their gold, but Leprechaun can agree for an exchange. Leprechaun can give you his pot of gold if you bring them wheat. Leprechaun need wheat because the biggest drought has come to his land and he doesnâ€™t have anything to eat. The only wheat in Medieville can now be got from Wheat Monsters. Wheat Monsters live near the village and vegetable fields.
