Faeries are small creatures with powerful magic that are often overlooked. Faeries magic overflows from them in the form of magic dust. Faeries have excess magic dust and can give it to those who show they have a pure heart. To show you have a pure heart you need to kill the gorilla and bring its heart. Faeries need gorilla heart because it can be a good protection and it can make other enemies withdraw from attacking. Faeries are attacked, because they are easy targets for predators. Faeries are tasty treats and spiders often hunt them to eat them. Kill the spider and get its fang to protect Faeries and in return you will get a magical crystal. Spiders live in the Dreary Forest with other monsters.
