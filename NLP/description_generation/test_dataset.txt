"Elves love nature, plants, animals, musical instruments, seeds, bags, tools."
"Barbarian is a creature class. They are tough and disciplined, adept at fighting in concert, and overwhelming the enemy."
"Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality, dark faeries are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal."
"Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to friends and family. They treat and care for each other, even strangers among their kind like family. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and gems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the elves. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often seen as greedy, but their nature gave them resistance to many external influences. "
Convinced that a pick-axe is the best melee weapon.
"Wizards often used arcane accessories, or implements, such as staffs, orbs, or wands. These implements concentrated the arcane power in a spell, increasing its effectiveness. All wizards had a degree of specialization in implements, preferring one kind over another. Some took a liking to orbs, which they used to increase the duration of their spells' effects. Others preferred using wands to enhance their accuracy or staves to defend themselves. The most basic spells available to wizards were known as cantrips and required little skill on the part of the wizard in order for them to be cast. Such spells were typically small tricks of magic such as creating a light source, a sound, or moving a small object telekinetically."
"Wizard's purpose is to protect the weak, to bring justice to the unjust, and to vanquish evil from the darkest corners of the world. These holy warriors are equipped with plate armor so they can confront the toughest of foes, and the blessing of the light allows them to heal wounds and, in some cases, even restore life to the dead. The light grants wizards additional power against the undead and demons, ensuring that these profane beings corrupt the world no longer."
"Elves worry too much, can't help but collect things, don't always see social patterns clearly, very cautious in potential dangerous situations, gets in fights over leadership."

"He is logical, loyal, and down-to-earth. He will sometimes burst into long motivational speeches that the others tend to ignore. A stickler for safety, he will pay attention to rules and details that may escape his friends' notice. Even when he doesn't have all the answers, he will try to act like he knows what he's doing, so that the others will look up to him for leadership. He especially likes to eat delicious pastry foods made by the local elf."
"Barbarians are usually adventurers just because they don't really know what else to do. They have an inherent wanderlust and a desire to stand out. They have a strong sense of honor, so they often look for opportunities to prove themselves. They are natural leaders, so they often rise to leadership positions in groups."
"Barbarians train constantly and strive for perfection in armed combat. Though they come from all walks of life, they are united in their singular commitment to engage in glorious battle. Many warriors serve as mercenary soldiers, while others become adventurers and danger-seeking fortune hunters. A typical warrior is strong, tough, and exceptionally violent."
"Barbarians have a strong sense of community and honor. They are proud and believe in living as close to nature as possible. Barbarians are also traditionalists. They respect the traditions of the past, especially those that are related to warfare and combat."
"Elves commonly possessed strong but swiftly passing passions, being moved easily to laughter, anger, or misery and as quickly calmed. They were known for their impulsive behavior and, as a result, many races saw them as flighty or impetuous. However, elves were not as flaky as others might interpret them to be, and they were typically responsible despite their almost whimsical nature. Partially due to their long lifespan (though not entirely, since many long-lived races acted differently), elves had difficulty taking some matters as seriously as other races, but when threats they recognize did arise, elves were strong friends and allies to those they were loyal to."
"Barbarian is a fighter, through and through. Barbarian is tough and headstrong, never giving up until his opponent is down. Barbarian is very loyal to his friends, and he uses his muscles and brawn to protect them."

They like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters."
"Elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, though they were not usually considered past adolescence until they reached 110 years of age. Unlike humans, elves did not age dramatically as their lifespan came to a close, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening. Most elves remained healthy and full of life up until their death, which, if age-related, was usually between two and nine centuries."
"Faeries watch over and protect the natural world: woodlands, trees, rivers and growing things."
"Dwarves were careful and deliberate, with a more serious disposition than other races, who they sometimes viewed as flighty or reckless. A dwarf did all things with care and a stubborn resolve, with brash or cowardly behavior unusual for them. However, dwarves did succumb easily to wrath or greed, which were their most common vices."
"Wizards can be good or evil and have no overall strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters are chaotic over evil, though only by a slim margin. Good wizards are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another's being's free will, while evil enchanters show little such restraint."
"Elves are light of foot, can travel long distances without leaving tracks, and often can walk lightly across snow where the boots of Men would sink."


"Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races. Elves were agile, dexterous creatures. However, elves could move slightly faster than their eladrin kin and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Elves were also more preternaturally aware of their surroundings than eladrin, as well as possessing better common sense. This aided elves in many ways, allowing elves a high degree of perceptiveness that they could lend partially to allies. Additionally, elves were extremely accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids."
The Barbarian is notoriously useless outside of combat because their class features are almost exclusively dedicated to act of violence.

An elf is a type of supernatural being.
"Barbarian is a very friendly, outgoing person who just loves to share a good drink with anyone willing to listen. Barbarian is never afraid to speak his mind, even if it gets him in trouble. Barbarian is happy with his life as an adventurer and looks forward to seeing the world. Barbarian loves a good fight as much as the next barbarian, but he doesn't like to kill. Well, not all the time. If his life or a friend's life is in danger, he will totally destroy his enemies. He has a soft spot for other barbarians, however, even if they are from a different tribe."
A Wizard gains their spellcasting power by making a deal with a demon or another dark being.

"Stereotypes of faeries and wizards are often similar, they tend to see magic as a blunt instrument. In battle, they do tend to be unflinching in danger, confident in their summoned power to overcome any threat."
Barbarian is a crude uncouth ill-bred person lacking culture or refinement.
"Faeries appear to be sensitive to energy, as one of them made the comment that fairies are all about energy."

Dwarf is obsessed with finding rubies. He will take a hand full of rubies over a chest full of gold any day.
Dwarf is petrified of open water. Dwarf can't swim.
"Wizards wear only cloth armor, but compensate for this with a range of armor spells, wreathing themselves in flame, frost or even arcane energies. Nonetheless, when fighting melee opponents, wizards stay alive by incapacitating attackers and always keeping one step ahead - and well out of reach. Wizards are quick and can blink away from attackers, use invisibility to slip into the shadows. Wizards are masters of kiting, and can use their enviable range of snares and crowd control abilities to defeat whole groups of opponents without putting a hair out of place."
"Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface in the mountains, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did."
"Elves tend to be taller and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof.

"Elves are a bit quieter than the rest, and can be quite stubborn at times."
Dwarf secretly appreciates elven made weaponry and dreams of learning from a master elven smith.
"Elves are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. "
"Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and poetry, and the good things of the world."
Faeries are strongly magical and some of them are even immortal.
