BARBARIAN
In the past, most barbarians lived in tribes. These tribes were nomadic, so they constantly traveled from place to place. They followed the animals that they hunted and maintained close relationships with the gods. They built up large camps that were made out of simple shelters and animal hides. Each tribe had a strong sense of community and family.
Over time, as civilization encroached, the tribes gradually merged with it. If the tribe was strong, it was often absorbed into the new culture. Sometimes the tribe was allowed to maintain its culture as a special group within the civilization. Most of the time, however, they were driven out to the fringes of civilization or the wilderness.
After surviving for so long as a separate and unique culture, the barbarians still look at themselves as different and superior to others. They have a strong sense of honor, and they are fiercely loyal to their friends. Barbarians are generally at peace with most races. They get along well with most groups with traditional warrior cultures. Barbarians generally hate those who they think have abandoned the warrior lifestyle and turned into cowards.
For as long as war has raged, heroes from every race have aimed to master the art of battle. Barbarians combine strength, leadership, and a vast knowledge of arms and armor to wreak havoc in glorious combat. Some protect from the front lines with shields, locking down enemies while allies support the warrior from behind with spell and bow. Others forgo the shield and unleash their rage at the closest threat with a variety of deadly weapons. The barbarian's battle cries embolden friends and leave foes cowering in fear. With legendary precision, warriors target the smallest gaps in armor and slice at hamstrings in a blur of steel.

He wears no armor, a practice that has resulted in many scars from what must have been dozens of battles. He lifts his head from his task, turning it slightly to reveal a tusked mouth and heavy brow. The half-orc knows you're looking.
When she was young, her parents were killed by a band of orcs in the night. She was able to escape with an older woman and two boys. She grew up on the streets of the land, learning the hard way. Still, she was able to learn much about the world. She grew up a fighter, always proving her own toughness. She learned how to read and write along the way, but she was never really interested in it. It was really just a means to communicate with others. While working as a barmaid, she was impressed by the gold and gems that the lord of the castle wore around his neck and on his fingers. She wanted to find a way to gather her own fortunes and riches. Her childhood friends persuaded her to leave the bar and become a hired sword to make a way for her future.
While he was still a young boy, he attended the prestigious school at kingdom. At school, he developed a love for drinking and fighting, which he would work on for the rest of his life. He joined an elite fighting squad that served the duke of the land, helping to protect the duke's lands. When he was a young man, he challenged the king to a fight. The duke won, and he was exiled from kingdom. He traveled to the vast grasslands of the plains, where he practiced his fighting skills and drank his fill.
Left alone in the world with no one to guide him, he became a recluse, ashamed of his lack of direction. He lived in fear of the outside world and sought solace only in his books. He devoted himself to learning more about the world, and of the glory of man. He dreamed of becoming a hero to those around him, and felt that he could do this by mastering the magical arts. With that in mind, he set off on his journey.
A female barbarian striking down with her blade.However, barbarians were united - no matter their origins - by a marked lack of discipline or patience for the laws and traditions that others adhered to. Likewise, while a generalization, it is true to some degree that nearly all barbarians came from outside the confines of settled civilization, being far more common among nomadic tribes or frontier settlers than they were among urban city dwellers. It is from these remote origins that barbarians often derived their reverence for nature, which brought them closer to druids, rangers, and others who venerated the wilderness.
Many barbarians were human, since humans were among the most widespread of the races, as well as in many cases, the most uncivilized. However, orc and goblinoid barbarians were more common still and were sometimes the most commonly encountered warriors of their race. Barbarians from other races were relatively rare, though among elves there were the wild elves, among halflings the ghostwise, and among dwarves the wild dwarves, each of which possessed barbarian traditions.

Barbarians' bravery and wanderlust made them uncommonly suited for the adventuring lifestyle. Often coming from nomadic tribes, most barbarians had few qualms with the traveling life typical to adventuring parties. Of the difficulties suffered by barbarians in adapting to a life of adventure, the greatest was most commonly the loss of family structure that comes from leaving the tribe. With time, however, many barbarians found the bonds with their new companions a worthy substitute.
Barbarians held varying attitudes towards magic. On the one hand, barbarians distrusted most things they did not understand and this extended towards what they called book magic or magic learned in a school or university, such as that used by swordmages or wizards.  On the other hand, barbarians were themselves wielders of primal magic, as were the druids many barbarians called friends or allies. Likewise, barbarians often showed a large degree of respect for sorcerers, whose approach to magic was similar to their own unbridled style of combat. In no small way, it was likely that the barbarian prejudice against scholarly magic was due in some part to the fact that many barbarians were illiterate.
A group of dragonborn barbarians. As handy with a weapon as a fighter, barbarians became tougher and more agile as they grew more powerful. The most experienced barbarians were almost incomparably powerful, with a strength and constitution well beyond that of most mortals.  Though barbarians often used one-handed weapons, many preferred to use two-handed weapons in order to deal more damage to their foes. Barbarians were also well-versed in the use of light armor, and many lacked training in heavier forms of protection such as chain shirts or shields, while very few were trained in and most lacked training in heavy armor, such as plate mail.
Because most of them were untrained in the use of heavy armor, barbarians trained themselves to take incredible amounts of punishment that could easily fell less sturdy warriors. Additionally, most barbarians were capable of moving much more quickly while wearing half plate or lighter armor, by a factor of between thirty and forty percent. Another boon to barbarians' feral and exposed style of attack was their aptitude for quickly following up one attack with another immediately thereafter, overwhelming their enemies until they were able to deal fatal blow. This, along with their instinctive sense for danger, which made them nigh impossible to flank effectively or put off guard, made barbarians far more formidable than their lightly armored appearance would suppose.
Many barbarians drew upon the primal energies of the natural world and its guardian spirits, often in the form of ancestral totems, for empowerment, gaining powerful abilities called evocations.  The feral might gained by barbarians could manifest in many other ways and some used it to empower themselves to the point of nigh invulnerability, finding it easier to take blows and plow onward rather than dodge them. Others gained the ability to literally shape their fate, affecting the quality of luck dealt them through force of will.
The most distinctive aspect of barbarians was their ability to rage, wherein they let loose powerful emotional bursts fueled by their primal power or inner fury.  When they raged, barbarians gained a number of powerful benefits, including an increase in physical prowess, and greater insensitivity to many forms of physical damage. This rage usually lasted about a minute, but with experience and training, most barbarians could extend it indefinitely.
Barbarians also were known to take on other, less common abilities. While raging, barbarians were typically unable to cast evocations, spells, or other similar abilities. Some barbarians were more skilled with lesser evocations whilst raging. Barbarians could also use a fraction of their raging power to deal a devastating attack known as a rage strike.
Barbarians came in a number of different varieties, with a number of diverse capabilities. Two of the main divergent branches of barbarians were the path of the berserker and the path of the totem warrior.
Where some barbarians drew upon the essence of nature and primal magic for their power, barbarians on the path of the Berserker instead relied on their own fury and unbridled bloodlust to pull them through a fight. As a result, berserkers relied less extensively on primal magic and instead focused on improving their rage ability. When a berserker raged they could enter into an even deeper state of primal fury known as a frenzy. While frenzied, a berserker was capable of attacking more quickly, although such effort eventually tired them out. Raging berserkers were also utterly fearless and immune to the effects of charms.
In addition to utilizing their rage in a way far greater than other barbarians, berserkers were also much more frightening to behold. Sufficiently powerful berserkers could actually cause their enemies to run in terror from them through their presence alone. Experienced berserkers also maintained exceptionally good battle reflexes, allowing them to strike a retaliatory blow to anyone who injured them in a fight.
Barbarians with a more spiritual side pursued the path of the Totem Warrior, a calling which enhanced the barbarians' capacity for primal magic and forging a strong connection between them and their spirit animal. The spirit animal chosen by Totem Warriors - which was often related to their particular tribal culture - granted them a number of supernatural abilities, such as the ability to carry extra weight, enhance the ability of their allies in battle, or even fly a limited distance in short bursts. Additionally, Totem Warriors also sometimes took on physical features similar to their spirit animal, such as excess hair or unusually colored eyes.
All Barbarians have a certain immunity to magic bound within them as a result of so much exposure to the powerful forces. Training in brute strength and physical force was the norm for Barbarians, with great endurance and vitality being praised. They came to be large people, with flaring tempers which makes the blood of a Barbarian truly boil when he is outraged. Chief weapon to the Barbarians was the axe, for it was this weapon that proved most useful to them in the forests and jungles where they resided. Their great strength allows them to wield other weapons in a single hand, but the axe is still the weapon of choice for most Barbarians.
From the shattered lands of the Medieville this proud race of people hails. A tribal and nomadic culture, the southern Barbarians prayed to no deity and swore allegiance to no leader. This was the reason that when the kingdoms of the Stormy Pier invaded the Barbarian lands, little resistance was found. The scattered villages fought valiantly, each man, woman and child battling to the death against the hordes of magic users from the distant lands, but to no avail. The lands of the Barbarians, beautiful forests and the majestic jungles, were conquered, and the tribes scattered to the four winds. Still proud, the tribes still gather occasionally, but they are small in number. They despised all magic, for it was this mystical force that was used against them in the wars they had fought. Their battles in the war taught them much about magic however.

The extended periods of time that most Barbarians spend away from their homes and civilization requires that they learn to repair their own weapons and armor, although their skill is no match for the talent of a true blacksmith
For ages, the Barbarians were shaped to be as strong and unyielding as stone. Immense in size and unmatched in ferocity, they were charged from birth with a duty passed through generations: to protect the world. They became aimless, haunted by their past, traveling from place to place without honor or direction.
Wild and bloodthirsty berserkers lurk on the fringes of civilisation, ever pressing in through feral forays to snatch what they can before vanishing back whence they came. Considered little more than animals, these savages are beyond counting and only kept at bay by the stout shields of soldiers & their fear of the bright lights of the cities.
People of towns and cities take pride in how their civilized ways set them apart from animals, as if denying one's own nature was a mark of superiority. To a barbarian, though, civilization is no virtue, but a sign of weakness. The strong embrace their animal nature keen instincts, primal physicality, and ferocious rage. Barbarians are uncomfortable when hedged in by walls and crowds. They thrive in the wilds of their homelands: the tundra, jungle, or grasslands where their tribes live and hunt.

In these perilous times, the defense of the mountain kingdom falls to brave dwarves like you. The spirits of the ancient kings watch over you, and the very mountains are your strength. The future of your people is in your hands.Great change has come to the enduring halls of Frozen Empire. Obsessed with the workings of the titans, the dwarves retrieved their creators' mystical tablets from the fabled city of Frozen Empire. Activating one such tablet, the king fell prey to a terrible curse that fused his statue-like form into the diamond heart of Frozen Empire itself. To compound this tragedy, king's estranged daughter, arrived claiming her father's throne for herself and for her infant evil son. To avert civil war, the dwarves created the council of dwarves, an uneasy coalition that would share power amonst the three clans. Now, with political upheaval arising in the kingdom and the great cataclysm ravaging the surrounding lands, the future of Frozen Empire falls to brave dwarves like you.The dwarves of Frozen Empire are an ancient race of robust humanoids who live beneath the snow-capped mountains of Frozen Empire. These dwarves have always been fast allies to the humans and they revel in the prospects of battle and storytelling alike.
Dwarves start out in their snowy homeland, specifically in Frozen Empire. Their capital city is the ice fortress of the mountains, which is where the council of dwarves rules over their united clans. The mount of choice for this stout folk is the ram. Whilst dwarves speak the common tongue of their human friends, their racial language is dwarven. As of the latest expansion, dwarf characters can select from every class except druid and demon hunter, a versatility matched only by trolls.
Dwarves' mountains were devastated during the war and their population slowly diminished during the Ice Age due to dwindling resources and predation by yetis. They survived past the Ice Age and now they reside in Frozen Empire.
These dwarves lived in the Dwarven household in the Frozen Empire. When the climate cooled and the goblins and orcs migrated away from their ancestral lands, the empire of the dwarves was the first to fall before their onslaught. In the legend of The Lady of the Frozen Empire, it is believed that a remaining few summoned the Lady and she teleported them away. It is believed by modern dwarves that they will return to save dwarvenkind from great peril.
Dwarves lived in the Frozen Mountains on during their interrace brothers' war. They provided the primal clay that the Dwarves' king used to create his clay statues and the Colossus of Frozen Empire. After years of service, dwarves' king found out that the dwarves were trading with his brother too they eventually rose against the king, and for this, they were slaughtered.
Dwarves lived in the Frozen Empire mountains alongside several human barbarian tribes. The dwarves were hardy miners and doughty warriors inclined toward passionate, explosive personalities. They exulted in battle, favoring swarm tactics supplemented by fire magic and destruction of enemy resources. Some of these dwarves were enslaved by the ruler of the land.
Dwarves live in the Frozen Empire mountains between Medieville and Misty Swamp. When other races settled on their land, the dwarves journeyed south, where they made an alliance with humans. This alliance led to tension between human and wizards when the amount of gold coming from the humans mines suddenly increased greatly thanks to dwarven technology.
Shield dwarves, are a subrace of dwarves, survived a long fall from grace, surrendering many of their ancient kingdoms in wars with goblins and orcs. These losses have lead to a cynical mindset, yet shield dwarves will endure anything to restore their ancestral homelands.
Dwarf wields a hammer because his father was a smith. And while that profession was not for him, he still honors his family every time he goes to battle.
Kingdoms rich in ancient grandeur, halls carved into the roots of mountains, the echoing of picks and hammers in deep mines and blazing forges, a commitment to clan and tradition, and a burning hatred of goblins and orcs these common threads unite all dwarves.
The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing. Even dwarves who live far from their own kingdoms cherish their clan identities and affiliations, recognize related dwarves, and invoke their ancestors' names in oaths and curses. To be clanless is the worst fate that can befall a dwarf.
Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.
ELF
Long ago the majestic high elves created the splendid golden city of Enchanted Forest, built around a magical fount of energy known as the Enchanted Forest's energy. When the king destroyed their capital in the war, the survivors turned to the horde for help. Now known as the blood elves, these refugees are all that remains of their glorious civilization. They strive to rebuild Enchanted Forest while struggling against a crippling addiction to the very magical energies that once built their empire. For nearly seven thousand years, the high elves cultivated a shining magical kingdom hidden deep within the forests of northern forest. But five years ago, the undead evil invaded Enchanted Forest and drove the elves to the brink of extinction. Led by the evil death knight, the evil destroyed the mystical city of Enchated Forest, thereby severing the elves from the source of their arcane power. Though the scars of that conflict are evident, the remaining elves have banded together and retaken much of their homeland. Calling themselves blood elves, these grim survivors are committed to regaining the vast powers they once commanded. Inspired by the leadership of their beloved prince, the blood elves now seek new sources of arcane magic and the means of defending their land against the undying horrors of the scourge. As one of the few surviving blood elves, you must master your thirst for magic and help shape the destiny of your people. The past few years have seen unprecedented changes within the eternal land of the Enchanted Forest. The blood elves, following the will of their crazed leader, channeled dangerous, chaotic magicks to transform their sacred the Enchanted Forest into a gateway of unspeakable evil. While the evil and its demonic masters were eventually defeated, a different transformation occurred within the Enchanted Forest itself as a dying elf sacrificed its life essence to reignite the Enchanted Forest as a font of holy energy. Now, the blood elf regent,  sees a new hope on the horizon for his people. Over time, the Enchanted Forest's Light could cure the blood elves of their cursed state, but many still cling to the arcane powers they procured and are hesitant to relinquish them. As one of the remaining blood elves, you must fight to protect Enchanted Forest and help redeem the soul of your ancient people. Long ago the exiled high elves landed on the shores of Specular Waters. They struck out to find a new home, and after many battles with the trolls, established the kingdom of Enchanted Forest. Using a vial of sacred water stolen from the first well of eternity, the high elves created a fount of mystical power at a convergence of ley energies in the Enchated Forest. They named this fountain the Enchanted Forest. Its potent arcane magic fed and strengthened the high elves, and soon the wondrous city of Enchanted Forest was established.
Protected by a magical barrier, the high elves enjoyed peace for roughly four thousand years, but that peace was not meant to last. The trolls gathered an immense army and assaulted the elven kingdom. Vastly outnumbered, the high elves hastily struck an alliance with the human nation. The elves taught a small number of humans how to wield magic. In exchange the humans aided the elves in destroying the trolls' power base forever. Over the following years the high elves returned to their reclusive ways, but during the war, the diabolical prince brought battle once again to their doorstep. They required the power of the Enchanted Forest to revive the necromancer and raise him as a lich. He invaded the Enchanted Forest and wiped out most of its population.
Additionally it became clear that the high elves had become addicted to the Enchanted Forest's arcane energies. Now that the source of their magic was gone, the few remaining high elves quickly grew ill and apathetic. Their prince, last of the royal line, returned from his studies in Misty Swamp to find the Enchanted Forest in ruins. Thirsting for vengeance, he gathered the survivors, renamed them blood elves, and took a group of the strongest fighters to join the campaign against the scourge.
Due to human prejudice, elves were forced to accept the assistance of reptilian naga. When the humans discovered that the blood elves had been working with the naga, elves and the others were imprisoned and condemned to death. Reptiles soon arrived to set them free, leading them through a portal and into the broken wastes of the world. There, the elves met the one being capable of putting an end to their hunger: the renegade night elf/demon.
Certain that the blood elves would die without assistance, elves agreed to serve the betrayer.
A lone representative was sent back to dungeons with a message of hope for the blood elves remaining in the Enchanted Forest: that one day elves would return to lead his people to paradise. Great progress had been made in teaching the blood elves advanced techniques to manipulate arcane energies. With renewed purpose, the blood elves have rebuilt the city of Enchanted Forest, though it is powered by volatile magics. Emboldened by the promise of elves return, the weary citizens of Enchanted Forest now focus on regaining their strength, even as they forge a new path into an uncertain future.
Elves would eventually return to Enchanted Forest, having forsaken his people for the burning legion.
Reinvigorated, the blood elves fight to protect Enchanted Forest, conquer their magical addiction with the Enchanted Forest's sustainment, and help redeem the soul of their ancient people.
While the territory has been separated, the Elves of the Enchanted Forest only inhabited a bit of land, but some time they can roam the whole plan again. Their society is run by a clairvoyant, which is related to their myth about Great Leader. Their entire culture revolved around worshiping the god of creation, and making sure his sleep was not disturbed.
The Enchanted Forest's Elves lived in the Enchanted Forest from ancients times.
She survived and was later part of the delegates on behalf of the Great Alliance against enemy. During this time it was mentioned as she was of the Enchanted Fores elves, and that she represented a vast confederation of woodland nations.
When, millennia later, he stumbled upon problem, he was helped by an unknown elf. This proved the doom of the island, however,  he told his father of the island. He soon traveled to it to use it for resources in his war against his brother the Brothers fought over their land in the last campaign of their war. The elves and other forest dwellers fought valiantly, but ultimately they were all destroyed when he activated the Great Volcano. The following volcanic eruption completely decimated the island, leaving only a small part behind that would later become Enchanted Forest.
During the Dark Age, the descendants of the Enchanted Forest's elves, frequently hired themselves out as mercenaries to the humans, for it gave them an opportunity to vent their hatred of humankind in battle.
The Enchanted Forest's elves were the survivors of the dark elves. They were slightly more open than their ancestors, engaging in diplomacy with the humans. When the Ice Age ended and the sea level rose, he was swallowed by the sea. 
Enchanted Forest's elves have very spindly, elongated limbs.  While all elves have strong ties to the land, the elves of Enchanted Forest are actually part of a hive culture, sharing the thoughts of Enchanted Forest simultaneously with their own. During the third phase of the Bad Invasion, part of Enchanted Forest was displaced. It is currently unknown if any elves from the Ancient Enchanted Forest's colony are still living. Great Lord is now the leader of the displaced portion of Enchanted Forest. In addition to the spindly, telepathic elves of Enchanted Forest, the forest also seemed to be home to some normal elves as well, including some barbaric elves with a warlike culture.
The elves of Enchanted Forest live in the realm of Happy Land. The elves actually used to be gods, before being replaced by the modern pantheon. After their defeat, the elvish leaders were imprisoned inside trees and the race was split into two clans. These two factions were alienated from each other for ages until recently, when an elf united the warring clans and named himself king. The elves are looking to reclaim some of their lost glory, and the reunification of their society is a step toward that goal.
Black elves were elves from the the domains who lived in the Dark Forest. They fought the forces of Vile Ruler and were forced to flee. They managed to poison him, but he recovered.
When she was sent to Wonderful Leader on behalf of the Elves Alliance, it was mentioned that she was of the distant elves and that she represented a vast confederation of woodland nations on the domains.
Enchanted Forest's culture placed great importance on the purity of the land. They had a brief era of prominence during the Dark.
The Enchanted Forest's elves lived on the highlands at the edges of the Sunny Valley. They could easily be mistaken for humans, as they were very similar in appearance - lacking even pointed ears. It was said that this ancient race possibly had a common ancestor with humankind. The main characteristic setting the Enchanted Forest's elves apart from humans was their great natural beauty and their wide eyes whose irises changed color according to their mood. Enchanted Forest's elves were also very deadly warriors, fighting solely with their own bodies and relying on their own speed, agility, and martial arts. Weapons were forbidden in their culture, and an elf who used them would be executed. They could be very brutal toward their own children, attacking them occasionally with fatal blows to teach them self-defense, killing those who were unable to defend themselves, ensuring that only the strongest children survive. They believe that in the afterlife they will find themselves in a some place. The history of thThe history of the Enchanted Forest's elves before their arrival in the Sunny Valley is unknown. Some tales say that the Enchanted Forest's elves once used weapons, very long and flexible swords which could be used almost like lashes. None could stand against them, but one day conflict arose between them, and civil war almost engulfed their race. The survivors swore never to use a weapon again and to kill those who dared. The Enchanted Forest's has a strict hierarchy, the full name of every member is comprised of his or her first name followed by the rank.
The Elves are a peaceful race that reside in Enchanted Forest. Their leader is the Prince of Elves, and they are related to the Dark Elves, the leader of whom has cast the Prince of Elves into a deep sleep. The Elves have four magic shops in their town and are of relatively small stature, which seems to imply they favor magic over physical might.
Through the leadership of Great Leader, the Enchanted Forest's Elves had become the largest and most prominent elf faction. Basing society within the massive treetops, the Enchanted Forest's Elves were open to other races and highly skilled innovators.
FAERIE
A sudden chill breeze, or ripples across the surface of water, are often indications that a faerie is nearby.
Before the Volcanic Eruption, faeries were most common on distant part of Enchanted Forest, where they were Magical-liquid-infused like all other lifeforms. 
During the New Age, faeries were among the few creatures to become even more powerful.
Faeries form south part of Lovey-dovey Land are known to be mischievous tricksters. The inhabitants have grown used to their pranks, with some having established basic security methods against them. Faeries are known to hunt trolls. The They put the small stature and great agility of the faeries to good use.  Some of the faeries repair and fine-tune many of the mechanical devices and they can also serve as messengers.
Some faeries were once humans who simply got lost in faerieland.
And then there are some faeries who are dangerous, so dangerous that, for centuries, people were too afraid of them to say their name aloud. These faeries usually live in hierarchies, where the king or queen is the most dangerous of all. They don't just get travelers lost; they lead them into deadly bogs. And if they ever share their dances or treasure with you, be sure that the gift comes with a curse. The most dangerous faeries can declare ware over small disputes. Fortunately, they are more likely to go to war with other magical creatures, like pixies or trolls.
If you're hoping to gain a faerie as a friend, leave a saucer of milk, cream, butter, or ale for the fey people to enjoy at night. If you do this on a regular basis, you might be rewarded!
Due to the legend of their origins, the faeries are associated with the beauty of angels and the viciousness and malevolence of the demons. Like angels, they are the least understood, the great ancient mystery from the Lovey-dovey Land. Although they are widely believed to be hybrid descendants of demons and angels.
She had once saved an entire village of farmers from bandits, despite being injured herself. When the thieves had been hoping for a successful night attack, she reached the town beforehand and woke the villagers by emitting an intense light.
Faeries, like vampires and werewolves, possess the unnatural abilities of swiftness, grace, and heightened senses of smell and hearing. The Faerie armies are also legendary in terms of their might in war.
The magic of the fey is believed to be unique in the world, they come from Lovey-dovey Land and currently living there. It is very old and powerful, but neither demonically nor seraphically aligned. They can harness the powers of the ley lines, along with other strange magics. 
As with any legend, there was a taste of truth within. Many fairies were tiny, and many of the legends about fey were quite true. Many fey, pixies, for example, could only be seen by those to whom they choose to reveal themselves, though powerful wizards could often make them out. Elves and fey were united by common belief, by their connection to natural purity, and for the fey, this was enough to create a connection of appearance. 
It was said that to protect oneself from fey one should carry iron, wear the color red, turn their clothing inside out, or be near running water. Iron was said to be detrimental to the skin of faeries, the color red and inside-out clothing a sort of camouflage because the Fair folk couldn't see it, and running water a source for disrupting magic spells or bad luck.

Wizards were generally the best-respected of all arcane spellcasters since they usually had a measure of discipline that was uncommon among other arcane spellcasters. Not all wizards were deserving of this reputation, however, and wizards could be as easily chaotic or evil as any other class. Prior to the Dark Age, wizards as a whole were associated with the good goddess , whom many worshiped, though goddess' death had ended this. Others worshiped her evil adversary, the goddess of darkness, giving them an entirely different reputation.

These things mean as much to a wizard as strength in battle.
