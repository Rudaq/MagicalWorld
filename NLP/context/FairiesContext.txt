Fairies are small creatures with powerful magic that are often overlooked. Fairies magic overflows from them in the form of magic dust. They have excess magic dust and can give it to those who show they have a pure heart. To show you have a pure heart you need to kill the gorilla that hunts fairies and bring back its heart. Gorilla heart can be a good protection for Fairies and make other enemies withdraw from attacking them.
