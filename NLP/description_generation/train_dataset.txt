"While there's no cultural norm for eye color, most barbarians have dark eyes."
"Elves take up adventuring out of wanderlust. Since they are so long-lived, they can enjoy centuries of exploration and discovery. They dislike the pace of human society, which is regimented from day to day but constantly changing over decades, so they find careers that let them travel freely and set their own pace. Elves also enjoy exercising their martial prowess or gaining greater magical power, and adventuring allows them to do so. Some might join with rebels fighting against oppression, and others might become champions of moral causes."
Elves have keener senses than Men.
"Barbarians are generally at peace with most species and cultures. They tend to get along with those who have warrior traditions. They are also closely tied to the natural world, so they are usually in harmony with nature."
"Barbarians have long, messy hair. They sometimes have beards. They are also some few characters who are allowed to wear their hair long."
"Barbarian characters have a strong sense of honor and duty. They are often the leaders in their groups. They are often used to being in dangerous situations, and they make good group leaders because they are used to dealing with difficult situations. They like to fight, and they are able to keep their groups moving in the right direction."
"Many dwarves have an affinity for the caverns in which they live, possessing a knack for recognizing unusual patterns in stonework that could almost seem supernatural at times. They are also renowned for their metalworking and crafting abilities."
"Barbarians are usually adventurers just because they don't really know what else to do. They have an inherent wanderlust and a desire to stand out. They have a strong sense of honor, so they often look for opportunities to prove themselves. They are natural leaders, so they often rise to leadership positions in groups."

"Faeries love honey cake, milk, nectar, and sweet butter."
"Dwarf has ornate metal bands adorning their beard, of brass and bronze, decorated to pay homage to the adventures they have been on so far."
Elves are immortal.
Elves are generally liked and even admired by humans and are easily accepted into their society. The same cannot be said for dwarves some of whom despise elves on principle.
"It is unusual for a barbarian to worship a god. Barbarians generally find it more natural to worship a pantheon of gods or nature. Many barbarians believe that they are a living incarnation of a god. Although barbarians have no formal religion, they have a strong sense of honor and loyalty. They try to emulate their gods by living in harmony with nature and fulfilling their duties."
"Barbarians come alive in the chaos of combat. They can enter a berserk state where rage takes over, giving them superhuman strength and resilience. A barbarian can draw on this reservoir of fury only a few times without resting, but those few rages are usually sufficient to defeat whatever threats arise."
"The earliest, and most common, faerie in Lovey-dovey Land are winged humanoid creatures of diminutive size (sometimes a foot in height or smaller) that are renowned for being great lovers of mischief. These faeries exist through the multiverse. These are also sometimes known as fae, pixies or sprites."
"Barbarian character has a sense of community and responsibility. Barbarians are loyal to their friends and family, and they have an obligation to protect the weak and innocent. Barbarians are used to adapting to dangerous situations and taking care of themselves. Barbarians have seen terrible things, but they choose to keep fighting so that they can protect others."
"As for armor, Dwarves favored chain-mail and other metallic armor where the most expensive and precious of which was ring mail made of gold."
"As a weapon they very often use axes, swords, hammers, mattocks."
Faeries are magical beings.
"As magical creatures, faeries have almost unlimited power. They can fly. They can make flowers bloom. They can conjure up gold. They can glow in the dark. They can create and cast new charms for any situation, and their curses can last for hundreds of years."
"Barbarian likes his life of adventure, traveling the countryside, earning gold, and drinking. "
"Elves typically live in forests, and are close to the land. In the game itself, many elves produce additional mana. Most elves look much like humans, only with pointed ears. Some types of elves have very distinctive physical features, however, such as blue or green skin or elongated limbs."
"Barbarians are the quintessential fearless fighters on the battlefield, and their pure martial prowess inspires courage in allies and despair in enemies. Experts in all manner of melee weaponry and possessing incredible physical strength and skill, Warriors are perfectly suited to serve as frontline combatants and battlefield commanders."
"Protects women with vastly more valor than men, even when he risks his own life."
"Elf is thoughtful, sensitive, and helpful. He has the patience and compassion needed to be a good dragon trainer. He is very knowledgeable about dragons, and his connection with them makes him a valuable elf to have around. His friends often come to him for treant-related advice, which he is always happy to give. He gives many compliments. Some might interpret this as flirting, but maybe he just sees the good in everyone around him."
"Barbarians have a strong sense of community and honor. They are proud and believe in living as close to nature as possible. Barbarians are also traditionalists. They respect the traditions of the past, especially those that are related to warfare and combat."

"Elves tended to make strong and uplifting friends. Most elves loved simple joys such as dancing, singing, footraces, or contests of skill. They had a natural aversion to that which they saw as uninteresting tasks and were fun-loving by nature. However, despite how unpleasant some things such as war could be, elves became grimly serious if a threat to their friends, family, or livelihood made such actions necessary."
"Dwarves were a short race, as their name implied, standing from 1.3 - 1.45 meters on average, with gold dwarves a bit shorter. What dwarves lacked in height they made up for in bulk"
An elf is a type of supernatural being.
"Their arms tend to be long, and they have rough skin. Coming up with a good physical description for your barbarian character is important because it can help you to think about how your character's appearance will affect their behavior and outlook on life."

"Faeries appear as beautiful creatures with pointed ears and glossy thin skin. This is however just an illusion to appeal to the dominant species of their current dimension. In reality they are much less attractive, appearing similar to wood elves or goblins. Faeries are super-humanly strong and durable. They possess longevity but are not outright immortal."
Keeps a record of the giants they've killed with notches in their axe or war hammer handle.
"Faeries come in many forms, and have been described as magical and mischievous beings from the realm next door. This realm is considered another dimension or reality. Faeries have been classified into two groups - one consisting of light faeries and the other dark ones. However, there have not been many details about identifying faerie classes."
"Unlike other elves, Dark Elves are a brutal race of supremacists who hide their savagery behind a facade of beauty and sophistication. They are obsessed with physical attractiveness and believe that those who do not meet their standards of perfection (including all races other than themselves) deserve nothing but extermination. Dark Elves are tall and thin. "
"Wizard's magic is a unique blend of arcane magic with the elemental power of creation and those who specialize in it are known as evokers. Wizards are often stubbornly determined by nature and have little use for distractions of the real world, living in very often spartan conditions. Many wizards are decisive and forthright, who are sure of what they must do, be it good or evil, giving them many qualities of strong leadership."

"Elves are generally considered one of the most beautiful races. They are slightly shorter and more delicate than humans and are not as hardy. Elves are a rare sight on the sword coast perhaps because they prefer the wild to human cities. While they are well known as a cheerful and frolicsome race, many elves, especially drow, are as surly as dwarves or as prideful as humans."
"Faeries watch over and protect the natural world: woodlands, trees, rivers and growing things."
"Dwarf has an intense fascination for plants. Likes flowers the most, with an especial interest for lilies."
Treats all Gnomes and Halflings as Dwarf babies.
"Faeries are not necessarily cowards but exhaust all other options before proceeding into combat. While faeries can be useful due to their anticipation of others' attacks some are irritatingly hesitant, making them nigh useless at times. When forced into battle, faeries are in natural opposition to illusionists, whose tricks they can unravel with their own spells."
"Elves come of age at around fifty years old, and generally marry around this age. Elves who marry late or never are said to have strange fates. Elves can tell in the eyes and voice of another Elf whether they are married, and it is against an Elf's nature to take another by force one so forced would reject bodily life and die. Because of the union of souls that occurs when Elves marry, and because of the eternal nature of Elven souls, they do not divorce or have multiple marriages. Elves have a taboo against incest, but marriage among second cousins is seen as acceptable. Whether this results in degradation from strong bloodlines is unknown."
"Although the Elves are more resistant to adverse environments and lack of food than Men, they can succumb to them thus Elves do require sustenance."
"Elves matured at roughly the same rate as humans, though they were not usually considered past adolescence until they reached 110 years of age. Unlike humans, elves did not age dramatically as their lifespan came to a close, with the most obvious changes being a change in hair color, alternatively graying or darkening. Most elves remained healthy and full of life up until their death, which, if age-related, was usually between two and nine centuries."
"Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk."

"Many dwarves were difficult to like and lacked the charm of many other smaller races, such as halflings or gnomes, though this was not a trait common to all dwarves and some possessed a great deal of charismatic power. Furthermore, dwarves were not entirely unsocial and more than a few had a natural knack for bartering or judging the value of an offer, something that sat well with their legendary crafting abilities."
"Elves are confident, helpful, nurturing and wise."
"Barbarians are in a constant state of physical conflict, so it's common for them to have obvious signs of past wounds. Barbarians also sometimes use scars and battle marks as tattoos, so if you have the option, you might want to avoid using the deformity rules."
Faeries are quick to do you a favor and even quicker to demand payment for it.
"A barbarian's true strength lies not in the body, but in the spirit."
Wizards are champions who call upon the light to heal wounds and combat evil.
"Wizards work with their allies more closely than some of the more single-minded wizard variants and this is one of their strengths. Wizards use their spells to overcome social obstacles, convince enemies to lay down arms, or put foes into a daze. The most dangerous ability of an wizard is their ability to turn an enemy into an ally, or vice versa, or to incapacitate an enemy in such a way that renders them as good as dead."
Elves can control water and have a special relationship with all animals.
Dwarf secretly hates beer as it's too bitter. Dwarf drinks rum instead.
"Glorified by many a song and fireside tale, the Barbarian is unrivaled in delivering unrelenting melee fury on anyone foolish enough to greet their axe-head."

"Barbarians are usually leading the charge into battle, tearing across the battlefield and using furious shouts and terrifying banners to rally their allies and intimidate their enemies. Whether striking down opponents with mighty two-handed weapons, tearing into packs of enemies in a whirlwind of steel, or standing firm in the face of death itself, warriors excel at battle with a range of powerful attacks and battlefield maneuvers, as masters of both skillful strikes and devastating blows."
"Elf has long black hair tinged with teal at the ends, which flows freely down her back. She also has piercing teal eyes, a pale complexion, a reddish-pink lip color, and a swirling black crown on her forehead."
"These barbarians, different as they might be, are defined by their rage: unbridled, unquenchable, and unthinking fury. More than a mere emotion, their anger is the ferocity of a cornered predator, the unrelenting assault of a storm, the churning turmoil of the sea."
"Faeries can only be seen if they want to be. This ability continues to work, even after the fairy in question's death, meaning humans who haven't been to the fairy realm can't see their remains."
All dwarfs have beards and wear up to twelve layers of clothing. Gender is more or less optional.
"Winged elves have feathered wings and are capable of flight. They are more delicate than their earth-bound cousins, with hollow bones to aid their flight. They have pale skin and slightly larger than normal eyes."
Faeries can live to be hundreds of years old.
"Faeries are known for their cunning and their cruel sense of humor, and they especially delight in tricking other creatures. Therefore, even though their land is beautiful, hardly anyone goes there. They frequently seek to bargain with others, offering someone their heart's desire but failing to mention that the desire comes with a terrible cost. They are committed to notions of honor and etiquette, and while faeries always exactly follow the letter of any promise they have made, they deliver these results with great irony and often use clever wordplay to their advantage in order to create loopholes."
"Wizards do battle to spread the shadows into the world. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the evil creatures and shadows which would serve them in the battle."
"Elves do not require sleep, but are able to enter a waking meditative state to regain their strength which means they can be exhausted and tire."
"A brutal, physical warrior, the Barbarian roams around the battlefield constantly, dishing heavy damage and wielding an array of powerful weapons with ease."
"Barbarians train constantly and strive for perfection in armed combat. Though they come from all walks of life, they are united in their singular commitment to engage in glorious battle. Many warriors serve as mercenary soldiers, while others become adventurers and danger-seeking fortune hunters. A typical warrior is strong, tough, and exceptionally violent."
"Barbarians are melee fighters highly trained in the arts of weaponry. These mighty warriors, strong and quick on the battlefield, depend on their heavy plate armor, shields, and battle prowess to defend themselves and ensure enemies don't focus on their softer-skinned allies. Weapon mastery is a staple of warrior training, and they are capable of delivering high damage with enormous two-handed weapons or by wielding two weapons. As barbarians deal or take damage, their rage grows, allowing them to deliver truly crushing attacks in the heat of battle."
"Wizards do battle to protect the world from the forces of shadow. Powerful warriors in their own right, they can also call upon the light to heal wounds, create shields of force, and incinerate evil creatures. "
"Dwarves in other lands are typically artisans, especially weaponsmiths, armorers, and jewelers. Some become mercenaries or bodyguards, highly sought after for their courage and loyalty."
"The Barbarian has unparalleled strength and expertly wields an entire arsenal in battle, with a weapon for every occasion. He bellows intimidating war cries and unleashes ground-shaking slams to send approaching hordes reeling."
"Wizards were a form of a spellcaster who learned the art of arcane magic through research and learning.  What wizards lacked in combat prowess and armor they made up with a broad range of magical spells and abilities learned through years of practice and training. Through their spellcasting ability, powerful wizards could control the battlefield, using spells that affected wide areas, often hindering enemies, while also learning to use powerful rituals of arcane power."
"Dwarf always carries around a small personal cask of ale for emergencies. Dwarf is concerned with filling it immediately after it empties, holds 4 servings of ale."
Faeries are strongly magical and some of them are even immortal.
"Most dwarves preferred living in underground cities near the surface in the mountains, built around mines that provided much of their livelihood. Carved into stone, these cities might take centuries to complete but were practically ageless once finished. Though dwarves were typically a martial race by nature, these cities had civilian populations that made up about one fourth of the total population and which were made up primarily of the young, the elderly, or a few regular adults. Females typically composed as large a portion of the military as male dwarves did."

"Wizards can be good or evil and have no overall strong alignment tendencies. Overall, enchanters are chaotic over evil, though only by a slim margin. Good wizards are defined by their restraint when it comes to using enchantments to violate another's being's free will, while evil enchanters show little such restraint."
"Barbarian talents can improve their already considerable defenses with a shield, increase their deadliness with two-handed weapons, or bolster their savagery while dual-wielding."

"Barbarians have tough, thick skin and are sometimes covered in scars. They often have a healthy tan."
"Most elves live far longer than humans, but it's unclear exactly how much. Elves not only live far longer than humans but also mature faster it is unknown if this is common to all elves or just those of the Enchated Forest."
"Combining a mastery of weapons and prowess in battle, Barbarians storm fearlessly into the front lines of any fight."
"Wizards who specialize in abjuration magic, spells that deflect or interact with other spells, are known as abjurers. These wizards are usually deliberate and prudent, seeing many other wizard specialists as reckless or wasteful. They like to be prepared, be it in research or adventuring, and often devote their free time to working out strategies for confronting other arcane spellcasters."
"Elves are wonderful. They provoke wonder. Elves are marvellous. They cause marvels.Elves are fantastic. They create fantasies. Elves are glamorous. They project glamour. Elves are enchanting. They weave enchantment. Elves are terrific. They beget terror. The thing about words is that meanings can twist just like a snake, and if you want to find snakes look for them behind words that have changed their meaning. No one ever said elves are nice. Elves are bad."
"Barbarian is a creature class. They are tough and disciplined, adept at fighting in concert, and overwhelming the enemy."
"A number of black-aligned spellcrafters are called wizards (though some are shamans instead of wizards). Some are necromancers, others make demonic pacts."
"Rage is the Barbarian's defining class feature. The bonus damage isn't huge, but it's reliable and consistent. The resistance to damage makes Barbarians exceptionally durable. You can rage multiple times in the same encounter if you absolutely need to, but your number of rages per day is limited, so try not to do so if you can avoid it."
"As time typically flows differently for them and in their realm, they are very long-lived and become only more artful and powerful as they age, though they are not immortal."
"Stereotypes of faeries and wizards are often similar, they tend to see magic as a blunt instrument. In battle, they do tend to be unflinching in danger, confident in their summoned power to overcome any threat."
Dwarf can't let a dare or slight against his courage slip by him. Always bites when someone calls him a chicken.
"They seem to have favoured simple durable clothing, coloured hoods and heavy cloaks for travelling, and belts of gold or silver. For battle their soldiers would have elaborately crafted armor and helmets, bearing various angles and styles that were trademarks of Dwarven crafting styles. Their armor was masked with symbols (after the manner of those used in forges for shielding the eyes) that were hideous to look upon."
"Faeries have long life spans, longer than other mortals and have the ability to choose when they die. They don't migrate to other lands."
"Dwarf is an avid wrestler, both the sport and the scripted spectacle. Knows all the underground wrestlers and where/when the biggest matches will be held. Goes every chance he gets."
"Barbarians are mighty warriors who relied on their strength and incredible toughness, characterized by a bestial rage empowered either by ancestral totems and nature spirits or an inner passion for violence. Barbarians were less versatile than fighters but were tougher and capable of dealing heavy damage to their foes much more quickly."

"Some faeries are helpful. They guide travelers who are lost in the forest back towards home. They help with household chores, often going to work overnight, so that their hosts wake up to a happy surprise. If they are particularly fond of you, they might even lead you to treasure, give you magical gifts, help you win your true love hand in marriage, or cast a lucky charm over your life."
"Elf has purple hair that is kept neatly combed. He also has turquoise eyes, a dark complexion, and two Elf Tattoos - one, a geometric design on his cheek, and the other, a pattern of swirls on his shoulder."
"Barbarian character is a traditionalist. Barbarian has a strong sense of duty and honor, and follows a strict code. Barbarian consider his actions to be the result of the decisions that he makes, and he would never seek to blame others for his decisions."
"Wizards are hosts of dark forces, sowing pestilence and horror."
"Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. "
Elves have pale complexion.
"Elves stood on average 1.7-2.0m and weighed 60-77kg. Usually, true elves were a naturally slender and athletic race. Elves had a similar range of complexions to humans, with wood elves typically coppery or pale skinned and wild elves having darker pigmentation. Often, elven hair was dark, either brown or black, with copper red or blond hair also found amongst wood elves, although orange or even green hues were not completely unheard of. Elven eyes are commonly brown, hazel, or an emerald green. Elves, like their cousins, were fair and beautiful, handsome, and had pointed ears and no body hair except eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair."
The oldest and strongest faeries are fallen angels.
"Long time ago, the dwarves made alliances with the elves, and both prospered from trade."
"Dwarves were a long-lived race, though not so much as elves, and reached physical maturity somewhat later than humans. A dwarf was traditionally considered an adult once he or she reached age fifty. Dwarves aged much like humans but over a longer period of time, remaining vigorous well past 150 years. Most dwarves lived to see their bicentennial and a few lived to be over 400. A dwarf was considered to be young until they reached the age of 50."
"Wizards are not only zealots, but also guardians of the righteous, and they bestow blessings on those the light would shine upon. The light radiates from wizards, and worthy allies who stand near them are emboldened by its power."
"Barbarian has green eyes and midnight black hair. His most distinguishing feature is the tattoo of his late mother on his left arm. He's very muscular and he has a strong, angular face. He wears hide armor and black trousers. The only weapons he requires is a small shield and a large knife."
"Some fairies, even some of the most ugly and horrifying, can be benevolent and helpful. Other fairies can be evil and malicious, even some of the most beautiful. What they have in common is that all fairies are considered to be both mischievous and capricious. They love to play tricks and their attitude can change from happy or friendly to ferocious without warning if they are somehow offended."
"Barbarian character has a strong sense of honor and tradition. Barbarian has close relationships with their tribe members, family members, and friends. Barbarian is used to fighting, and they see battle as a natural part of life. Barbarian isn't afraid to fight, and he isn't afraid to die. Barbarian doesn't see life as something that should be wasted."
Dwarf secretly appreciates elven made weaponry and dreams of learning from a master elven smith.
"Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully."
"Elves worry too much, can't help but collect things, don't always see social patterns clearly, very cautious in potential dangerous situations, gets in fights over leadership."
"Dwarf likes reading history, especially about heroes and battles that are often overlooked in traditional history books."
"Elves had a number of abilities that set them apart from other humanoid races. Elves were agile, dexterous creatures. However, elves could move slightly faster than their eladrin kin and could move swiftly through even the roughest terrain. Elves were also more preternaturally aware of their surroundings than eladrin, as well as possessing better common sense. This aided elves in many ways, allowing elves a high degree of perceptiveness that they could lend partially to allies. Additionally, elves were extremely accurate in their attacks, having a degree of precision that would be unusual for other humanoids."
Dwarf hates heights and actively avoids climbing unless they must.
"As a Dark Elf, her long black dress has a bat-shaped design on the torso in teal and pale-yellow. There is another bat-shaped design at the bottom of her skirt, solely in teal. Grey swirls surround these bat-emblems. The left side of her dress is long-sleeved, while the right side is sleeveless. To complete the look, she dons a teal cape with a jagged, bat-like finish at the bottom."
"Dwarves were typically stubborn, secretive, and fiercely loyal to friends and family. They treat and care for each other, even strangers among their kind like family. They cared greatly about mining, crafting, crafts, gold and gems, their acquisition of which often fueled the envy of the elves. Dwarves were easily offended by rude comments, and had a propensity to hold long-lasting grudges. Dwarves were often seen as greedy, but their nature gave them resistance to many external influences. "
"Elves are immortal, in the sense that they are not susceptible to aging and disease."
"Dwarf collects random animal parts, herbs, spices, and other unique ingredients in an attempt to craft the best ale in the world. Loves this hobby."
"Most of wizards like isolation, as it means they can carry out their dangerous experiments undisturbed by others and only leave their enclaves either to accumulate more power or the necessary wealth to continue their research."
"The elves are deeply in tune with the flow of aether and the subtle ways it influences and shapes the natural world. Their inventions are inspired by nature and in turn they inspire others, offering a vision of progress that is elegant, efficient, and harmonious with the aether patterns. "
Elves are said to have the most beautiful voices of all kinds. This makes them highly sought after by bards.
Elves are immune to illness and not subject to age after reaching their prime.
"Dwarves are a short but stocky race that inhabits Frozen Empire. What a regular dwarf lacks in in height (measuring between 4 and 5 feet), he makes up for in bulk, weighing as much as a mature human. Dwarven males are a bit taller and heavier than their female counterparts."

Wizards are dark avengers who call upon the darkness to spread evil and conquer the world.
"Elf is a sensitive daydreamer, who is not afraid to follow her dreams and loves to sail the Ocean. With her quiet bravery and wisdom she is pretty popular, and her empathetic, nice and patient personality makes her an important element in a group."
"Most barbarians are noble and serve their duty unflinchingly. Barbarians are often equipped with a long sword and a short sword in many lands where barbarians are found, they are the only citizens allowed to carry more than one weapon. The ability, representing their power in combat, is exclusive to barbarians. Most barbarians are aligned with white."
"Faeries specialize in the anticipation of events through time and space, either in the future or a far away location. Faeries are notable for possessing an unusually high wisdom from wizards, with strong and cautious judgment, preferring to use violence only as a last resort. Many faeries are also strong judges of character, with an insightful nature in all matters."
Dwarf's skin is so rough that he can light a match on any part of his body.

Regrets serving their old god and is looking for a new one.
"Elf has a special bond with nature (on land), can make anything grow and thrive, can magically talk to plants and animals, is physically strong."
"Barbarian is a fighter, through and through. Barbarian is tough and headstrong, never giving up until his opponent is down. Barbarian is very loyal to his friends, and he uses his muscles and brawn to protect them."
"Wizard's soul is inundated with power.Wizards are a type of magic user. Athletic, affable, and self-assured, wizards hardly seem like scholarly bibliophiles hidden away from civilization. They possess many of the same skills as the male members of the magic clans, but excel at the use of elemental magic."
"Elves are very similar to Men. Unlike Men, however, they are immortal, in that their bodies do not age once they have reached maturity, so that they do not seem to become elderly or die of old age. They can be killed by physical injury however, or they may come to death from wasting away if after long eons of life they lose the will to live. "
"Barbarian is a tall man with slightly long brown hair. He tends to wear whatever is comfortable, usually something unusual, like a cloak made from a lion's hide. Hev is not a very handsome man, but he moves with great, athletic strength. When in battle, he usually wears next to nothing, save for a metal breast-plate taken from a slain berserker. He carries a war hammer, which he forged himself from the metal of a fallen statue. He keeps his hair greasy so opponents can't get a good grip on him."
"Faeries collect unusually valuable things: coins of fallen empires, baby teeth, and memories of treasured name."
"Barbarian is a creature class. Barbarians, are warriors who have sworn their service and their lives to a single authority figure, usually a feudal lord."
"Wizard are naturally adept at combat, making them some of the most common wizard adventurers. Most evocation spells have an immediately obvious combat application, such as magic missile or fireball and make evokers valued combatants who often serve as a form of magical artillery on the battlefield."
"Barbarians wear clothes that are rough and rugged. While many stereotypes depict barbarians as wearing nothing but a loincloth, but this is rarely true. Barbarians come from the wilds outside society, but this doesn't mean that they don't have their own sense of class and style. Some barbarian cultures favor colorful clothing and ornate jewelry."
"Dwarves are solid and enduring like the mountains they love, weathering the passage of centuries with stoic endurance and little change. They respect the traditions of their clans, tracing their ancestry back to the founding of their most ancient strongholds in the youth of the world, and don't abandon those traditions lightly. Part of those traditions is devotion to the gods of the dwarves, who uphold the dwarven ideals of industrious labor, skill in battle, and devotion to the forge."
The Elves are a peaceful race that reside in their kingdom.

"It's important to be aware that most faeries have fluid personalities. They can go from helpful to mischievous quickly, and despite their cleverness, they don't have to have a reason for their decisions!"
"Barbarians can be excellent warriors. While not as disciplined or as skilled as a normal fighter, the barbarian can willingly throw himself into a berserk rage, becoming a tougher and stronger opponent. Barbarians can't use plate mail armor, unlike the other three warrior classes. They use the fighter avatar for their appearance. The Barbarian can draw from a high level ability pool which gives the barbarian some extra abilities."
This fearless warrior relies on his bulging muscles and striking mustache to wreak havoc in enemy villages. Release a horde of Barbarians and enjoy the mayhem!
"Likes to hum 'Heigh Ho' to themselves. When asked why, they fervently deny it saying, 'I was not.'"
Convinced that a pick-axe is the best melee weapon.
"Dwarves were a proud and stern race and were made to be sturdy to resist the dangers of their time. They were physically very strong, had great endurance, especially in the ability to resist heat and cold, and they made light of heavy burdens. Dwarves lived longer than Men, often up to two-hundred-and-fifty years. Dwarves had the ability to learn new artisanal skills quickly, especially those dealing with metal or stone."
"Dwarf is very attracted to halflings, vastly more so then to other dwarves. But they'd never let their parents find out."
"Wizards were also skilled in the use of rituals, powerful spells that require a significant amount of time and energy to cast, thereby making them impractical in battle but immensely useful in non-combat applications. As with their daily spells (spells which a wizard can only master once per day), wizards kept these rituals written in a spellbook, where each ritual took up at least a page, with complexity and page length directly proportional to the power inherent in a ritual."
"Faeries are magical by nature and live in magical, pink biom."
"Wizards wear only cloth armor, but compensate for this with a range of armor spells, wreathing themselves in flame, frost or even arcane energies. Nonetheless, when fighting melee opponents, wizards stay alive by incapacitating attackers and always keeping one step ahead - and well out of reach. Wizards are quick and can blink away from attackers, use invisibility to slip into the shadows. Wizards are masters of kiting, and can use their enviable range of snares and crowd control abilities to defeat whole groups of opponents without putting a hair out of place."


Honors their deep dwarf roots by lighting the end of their braids or moustache on fire before battle to intimidate enemies.
"Most dwarven clans focused on one or two kinds of crafting, such as blacksmithing, jewelry, engineering, or masonry. Dwarves strove to avoid overspecialization by sending some of their youths to other clans to serve as apprentices, which also helped to foster racial unity. Because of their longevity, these apprenticeships might last decades."
Elves occasionally also were benevolent and helpful.
"The Barbarian is a champion, swordsman, swordswoman, soldier, and brawler who lives or dies by the knowledge of weapons and tactics. Barbarians can be found at the front of any battle, contesting toe-to-toe with monsters and villains. A good Barbarian needs to be strong and healthy if they hope to survive."
"Elves are tall, agile, graceful, wise, fair."
"They had a knack for starting a fire almost anywhere out of almost anything. Although they knew how, Dwarves did not farm or herd often, as they preferred to spend their time underground mining and crafting. They rather traded crafted items with Men and Elves in exchange for food."
Dwarf is petrified of open water. Dwarf can't swim.
"He is logical, loyal, and down-to-earth. He will sometimes burst into long motivational speeches that the others tend to ignore. A stickler for safety, he will pay attention to rules and details that may escape his friends' notice.

However, barbarians, while undoubtedly feral and unpredictable by the nature of their rages, were not necessarily uncultured brutes.

Barbarian speaks with a thick accent and swears a lot. He's a loud, boisterous man who laughs and tells stories constantly. He acts like a berserker who fights for the fun of it.

"Elves are a magical people of otherworldly grace, living in the world but not entirely part of it. They live in places of ethereal beauty, in the midst of ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze.

Dwarven stomachs, for instance, are resistant to virtually all poisons and it takes less effort for a dwarf to get back on their feet than other races.

Supposedly, her friend created the Specular Waters as a gift for her, when in reality it was nothing more than a trap. She has been banished for so long that she is thought to be nothing more than a myth. The Legend of she is a tale that elves tell children to frighten them. But as she prepares to put her schemes into motion, the land of elves will soon realize that this dangerous foe is all too real."
"Elves tend to be taller and slimmer than humans. Their features are finely chiseled and delicate, and they speak in melodic tones. Elves are looked upon as being frivolous and aloof.

Well, not all the time. If his life or a friend's life is in danger, he will totally destroy his enemies. He has a soft spot for other barbarians, however, even if they are from a different tribe."
